<p>The compilers of this book would be wanting in courtesy if they
did not expressly say what might otherwise be safely left to the
reader’s discernment: the frequent appearance in it of any author’s or
newspaper’s name does not mean that that author or newspaper offends
more often than others against rules of grammar or style; it merely
shows that they have been among the necessarily limited number chosen
to collect instances from.</p>

<p>The plan of the book was dictated by the following considerations.
It is notorious that English writers seldom look into a grammar or
composition book; the reading of grammars is repellent because, being
bound to be exhaustive on a greater or less scale, they must give much
space to the obvious or the unnecessary; and composition books are
often useless because they enforce their warnings only by fabricated
blunders against which every tiro feels himself quite safe. The
principle adopted here has therefore been (1) to pass by all rules,
of whatever absolute importance, that are shown by observation to be
seldom or never broken; and (2) to illustrate by living examples, with
the name of a reputable authority attached to each, all blunders that
observation shows to be common. The reader, however, who is thus led to
suspect that the only method followed has been the rejection of method
will find, it is hoped, a practical security against inconvenience in
the very full Index.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span></p>

<p>Further, since the positive literary virtues are not to be taught by
brief quotation, nor otherwise attained than by improving the gifts
of nature with wide or careful reading, whereas something may really
be done for the negative virtues by mere exhibition of what should be
avoided, the examples collected have had to be examples of the bad
and not of the good. To this it must be added that a considerable
proportion of the newspaper extracts are, as is sometimes apparent,
not from the editorial, but from the correspondence columns; the names
attached are merely an assurance that the passages have actually
appeared in print, and not been now invented to point a moral.</p>

<p>The especial thanks of the compilers are offered to Dr. Bradley, joint
editor of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, who has been good
enough to inspect the proof sheets, and whose many valuable suggestions
have led to the removal of some too unqualified statements, some
confused exposition, and some positive mistakes. It is due to him,
however, to say that his warnings have now and then been disregarded,
when it seemed that brevity or some other advantage could be secured
without great risk of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> itself has been of much service.
On all questions of vocabulary, even if so slightly handled as in the
first chapter of this book, that great work is now indispensable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General</span></h3>

<p>Any one who wishes to become a good writer should endeavour, before he
allows himself to be tempted by the more showy qualities, to be direct,
simple, brief, vigorous, and lucid.</p>

<p>This general principle may be translated into practical rules in the
domain of vocabulary as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefer the familiar word to the far-fetched.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefer the concrete word to the abstract.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefer the single word to the circumlocution.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefer the short word to the long.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefer the Saxon word to the Romance.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These rules are given roughly in order of merit; the last is also
the least. It is true that it is often given alone, as a sort of
compendium of all the others. In some sense it is that: the writer
whose percentage of Saxon words is high will generally be found to
have fewer words that are out of the way, long, or abstract, and fewer
periphrases, than another;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> and conversely. But if, instead of his
Saxon percentage’s being the natural and undesigned consequence of
his brevity (and the rest), those other qualities have been attained
by his consciously restricting himself to Saxon, his pains will have
been worse than wasted; the taint of preciosity will be over all he
has written. Observing that <i>translate</i> is derived from Latin,
and learning that the Elizabethans had another word for it, he will
pull us up by <i>englishing</i> his quotations; he will puzzle the
general reader by introducing his book with a <i>foreword</i>. Such
freaks should be left to the Germans, who have by this time succeeded
in expelling as aliens a great many words that were good enough
for Goethe. And they, indeed, are very likely right, because their
language is a thoroughbred one; ours is not, and can now never be,
anything but a hybrid; <i>foreword</i> is (or may be) Saxon; we can
find out in the dictionary whether it is or not; but <i>preface</i> is
English, dictionary or no dictionary; and we want to write English,
not Saxon. Add to this that, even if the Saxon criterion were a safe
one, more knowledge than most of us have is needed to apply it.
Few who were not deep in philology would be prepared to state that
no word in the following list (extracted from the preface to the
<i>Oxford Dictionary</i>) is English:—<i>battle</i>, <i>beast</i>,
<i>beauty</i>, <i>beef</i>, <i>bill</i>, <i>blue</i>, <i>bonnet</i>,
<i>border</i>, <i>boss</i>, <i>bound</i>, <i>bowl</i>, <i>brace</i>,
<i>brave</i>, <i>bribe</i>, <i>bruise</i>, <i>brush</i>, <i>butt</i>,
<i>button</i>. Dr. Murray observes that these ‘are now no less
“native”, and no less important constituents of our vocabulary, than
the Teutonic words’.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, innumerable pairs of synonyms about which the
Saxon principle gives us no help. The first to hand are <i>ere</i>
and <i>before</i> (both Saxon), <i>save</i> and <i>except</i> (both
Romance), <i>anent</i> and <i>about</i> (both Saxon again). Here, if
the ‘Saxon’ rule has nothing to say, the ‘familiar’ rule leaves no
doubt. The intelligent reader whom our writer has to consider will
possibly not know the linguistic facts; indeed he more likely than not
takes <i>save</i> for a Saxon word. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> he does know the reflections
that the words, if he happens to be reading leisurely enough for
reflection, excite in him. As he comes to <i>save</i>, he wonders, Why
not <i>except</i>? At sight of <i>ere</i> he is irresistibly reminded
of that sad spectacle, a mechanic wearing his Sunday clothes on a
weekday. And <i>anent</i>, to continue the simile, is nothing less
than a masquerade costume. The <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> says drily of
the last word: ‘Common in Scotch law phraseology, and affected by many
English writers’; it might have gone further, and said ‘“affected”
in any English writer’; such things are antiquarian rubbish,
Wardour-Street English. Why not (as our imagined intelligent reader
asked)—why not <i>before</i>, <i>except</i>, and <i>about</i>? Bread
is the staff of life, and words like these, which are common and are
not vulgar, which are good enough for the highest and not too good for
the lowest, are the staple of literature. The first thing a writer must
learn is, that he is not to reject them unless he can show good cause.
<i>Before</i> and <i>except</i>, it must be clearly understood, have
such a prescriptive right that to use other words instead is not merely
not to choose these, it is to reject them. It may be done in poetry,
and in the sort of prose that is half poetry: to do it elsewhere is to
insult <i>before</i>, to injure <i>ere</i> (which is a delicate flower
that will lose its quality if much handled), and to make one’s sentence
both pretentious and frigid.</p>

<p>It is now perhaps clear that the Saxon oracle is not infallible; it
will sometimes be dumb, and sometimes lie. Nevertheless, it is not
without its uses as a test. The words to be chosen are those that
the probable reader is sure to understand without waste of time and
thought; a good proportion of them will in fact be Saxon, but mainly
because it happens that most abstract words—which are by our second
rule to be avoided—are Romance. The truth is that all five rules would
be often found to give the same answer about the same word or set of
words. Scores of illustrations might be produced; let one suffice:
<i>In the contemplated eventuality</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> (a phrase no worse than what
any one can pick for himself out of his paper’s leading article for
the day) is at once the far-fetched, the abstract, the periphrastic,
the long, and the Romance, for <i>if so</i>. It does not very greatly
matter by which of the five roads the natural is reached instead of the
monstrosity, so long as it <i>is</i> reached. The five are indicated
because (1) they differ in directness, and (2) in any given case only
one of them may be possible.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to a few examples of how not to write, roughly
classified under the five headings, though, after what has been
said, it will cause no surprise that most of them might be placed
differently. Some sort of correction is suggested for each, but the
reader will indulgently remember that to correct a bad sentence
satisfactorily is not always possible; it should never have existed,
that is all that can be said. In particular, sentences overloaded
with abstract words are, in the nature of things, not curable simply
by substituting equivalent concrete words; there can be no such
equivalents; the structure has to be more or less changed.</p>

<p>By way of general rules for the choice of words, so much must suffice.
And these must be qualified by the remark that what is suitable for
one sort of composition may be unsuitable for another. The broadest
line of this kind is that between poetry and prose; but with that we
are not concerned, poetry being quite out of our subject. There are
other lines, however, between the scientific and the literary styles,
the dignified and the familiar. Our rendering of the passage quoted
from Mr. Balfour, for instance, may be considered to fall below the
dignity required of a philosophic essay. The same might, with less
reason, be said of our simplified newspaper extracts; a great journal
has a tone that must be kept up; if it had not been for that, we should
have dealt with them yet more drastically. But a more candid plea for
the journalist, and one not without weight, would be that he has not
time to reduce what he wishes to say into a simple and concrete form.
It is in fact as much easier for him to produce, as it is harder for
his reader to understand, the slipshod abstract stuff that he does
rest content with. But it may be suspected that he often thinks the
length of his words and his capacity for dealing in the abstract
to be signs of a superior mind. As long as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> opinion prevails,
improvement is out of the question. But if it could once be established
that simplicity was the true ideal, many more writers would be found
capable of coming near it than ever make any effort that way now. The
fact remains, at any rate, that different kinds of composition require
different treatment; but any attempt to go into details on the question
would be too ambitious; the reader can only be warned that in this
fact may be found good reasons for sometimes disregarding any or all
of the preceding rules. Moreover, they must not be applied either so
unintelligently as to sacrifice any really important shade of meaning,
or so invariably as to leave an impression of monotonous and unrelieved
emphasis.</p>

<p>The rest of this chapter will be devoted to more special and definite
points—malaprops, neologisms, Americanisms, foreign words, bad
formations, slang, and some particular words.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Malaprops</span></h3>

that it has the meaning really belonging to another word that resembles
it in some particular.</p>

<p>As it stands, it implies that he came chiefly from Fez, but from other

particular interview, and had no other motive. The differentiation
of <i>spec-</i> and <i>espec-</i> is by no means complete yet, but
some uses of each are already ludicrous. Roughly, <i>spec-</i> means
particular as opposed to general, <i>espec-</i> particular as opposed

<p><i>Euphemism</i> is slurring over badness by giving it a good name:
<i>euphuism</i> is a literary style full of antithesis and simile.
A pair of extracts (<i>Friedrich</i>, vol. iv, pp. 5 and 36) will
convince readers that these words are dangerous:</p>

<p>5. <b>Words whose meaning is misapprehended without apparent cause.</b>
The hankering of ignorant writers after the unfamiliar or imposing
leads to much of this. We start with two uses of which correct and
incorrect examples are desirable: <i>provided</i>, where <i>if</i> is
required; and <i>to eke out</i> in wrong senses. <i>Provided</i> adorns
every other page of George Borrow; we should have left it alone as an
eccentricity of his, if we had not lately found the wrong use more than
once in <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p><i>Provided</i> is a small district in the kingdom of <i>if</i>; it can
never be wrong to write <i>if</i> instead of <i>provided</i>: to write
<i>provided</i> instead of <i>if</i> will generally be wrong, but now
and then an improvement in precision. So much is clear; to define the
boundaries of the district is another matter; we might be wiser merely
to appeal to our readers whether all the examples to be quoted, except
one, are not wrong. But that would be cowardly; we lay down, then, that
(<i>a</i>) the clause must be a stipulation, i. e., a demand yet to be
fulfilled, (<i>b</i>) there must be a stipulator, who (<i>c</i>) must
desire, or at least insist upon, the fulfilment of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ganganelli would never have been poisoned <i>provided</i> he had had
nephews about to take care of his life.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There is no stipulator or stipulation. Grammar would have allowed
Providence to say to him ‘You shall not be poisoned, provided you
surround yourself with nephews’.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The kicks and blows which my husband Launcelot was in the habit of
giving me every night, <i>provided</i> I came home with less than five
shillings.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Launcelot, the stipulator, does not desire the fulfilment. If
<i>kisses</i> are substituted for <i>kicks and blows</i>, and
<i>more</i> for <i>less</i>, the sentence will stand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She and I agreed to stand by each other, and be true to old Church of
England, and to give our governors warning, <i>provided</i> they tried
to make us renegades.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The stipulators, she and I, do not desire the fulfilment. <i>Not</i> to
give warning, provided they did <i>not</i> try, would be English. There
is similar confusion between the requirements of negative and positive
in the next:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A society has just been founded at Saratoff, the object being,
as the members declare in a manifesto to the Liberals, to use
violent methods and even bombs <i>provided</i> the latter do so
themselves.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>In these circumstances the chances are that the direction to proceed
to Vladivostok at all costs, <i>provided</i> such instruction
<i>were</i> ever given, may have been reconsidered.—<i>Times.</i> (if
indeed ... was)</p>
</div>

<p>There is no stipulation; it is only a question of past fact.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What will the War Council at the capital decide <i>provided</i> the
war is to continue?... The longer Linevitch can hold his position the
better, provided he does not risk a serious action.—<i>Times.</i>
(if, or assuming that)</p>
</div>

<p>There is no stipulation, stipulator, or desire—only a question of
future fact. The second <i>provided</i> in this passage is quite
correct. The <i>Times</i> writer—or the Russian War Council, his
momentary client—insists that Linevitch shall not run risks, and
encourages him, if that stipulation is fulfilled, to hold on.</p>

<p>To <i>eke out</i> means to increase, supplement, or add to. It may be
called a synonym for any of these verbs; but it must be remembered that
no synonyms are ever precise equivalents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> The peculiarity of <i>eke
out</i> is that it implies difficulty; in technical language, agreeing
with <i>supplement</i> in its denotation, it has the extra connotation
of difficulty. But it does not mean to make, nor to endure. From its
nature, it will very seldom be used (correctly), though it conceivably
might, without the source of the addition’s being specified. In the
first of the quotations, it is rightly used; in the second it is given
the wrong meaning of <i>make</i>, and in the last the equally wrong one
of <i>endure</i>.</p>

<p>Next, some isolated illustrations of our present heading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘There are many things in the commonwealth of Nowhere, which I rather
wish than hope to see adopted in our own.’ It was with these words of
characteristic <i>irony</i> that More closed the great work.—<span class="smcap">J.
R. Green.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The word <i>irony</i> is one of the worst abused in the language; but
it was surely never more gratuitously imported than in this passage.
There could be no more simple, direct, and literal expression of More’s
actual feeling than his words. Now any definition of irony—though
hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must
include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of
what is said are not the same. The only way to make out that we have
irony here is to suppose that More assumed that the vulgar would think
that he was speaking ironically, whereas he was really serious—a
very topsy-turvy explanation. <i>Satire</i>, however, with which
<i>irony</i> is often confused, would have passed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

generations later, of the very respectable William Lamb (afterwards
Lord Melbourne), his unhappy wife, Lady Caroline Lamb, and Lord
Byron.—<i>Times.</i> (reincarnation, avatar, resurrection?)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Recrudescence</i> is becoming quite a fashionable journalistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
word. It properly means the renewed inflammation of a wound, and so
the breaking out again of an epidemic, &amp;c. It may reasonably be used
of revolutionary or silly opinions: to use it of persons or their
histories is absurd.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A colonel on the General Staff, while arguing for a continuation of
the struggle on <i>metaphysical</i> grounds, admitted to me that
even if the Russians regained Manchuria they would never succeed
in colonizing it.... The <i>Bourse Gazette</i> goes still further.
It says that war for any definite purpose ceased with the fall
of Mukden, and that its <i>continuation is apparent</i> not from
any military or naval actions, but from the feeling of depression
which is weighing upon all Russians and the reports of the peace
overtures.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We can suggest no substitute for <i>metaphysical</i>. Though we have
long known <i>metaphysics</i> for a blessed and mysterious word,
this is our first meeting with it in war or politics. The ‘apparent
continuation’, however, seems darkly to hint at the old question
between phenomena and real existence, so that perhaps we actually are
in metaphysics all the time.</p>

</div>

<p>As a synonym for <i>become known</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>transpire</i> is

</div>

<p>To <i>demean</i> oneself, with adverb of manner attached, is to
behave in that manner. The other use has probably arisen by a natural
confusion with the adjective <i>mean</i>; one suspects that it has
crept into literature by being used in intentional parody of vulgar
speech, till it was forgotten that it was parody. But perhaps when a
word has been given full citizen rights by Thackeray and Stevenson, it
is too late to expel it.</p>

<p>This jest would be pedantic in any case, since no one but schoolmasters

one represented in English by <i>I shall have been killed</i>, it has,
further, no application here; <i>paulo-ante-past tense</i>, if there

<p>We have touched shortly upon some four dozen of what we call malaprops.
Now possible malaprops, in our extended sense, are to be reckoned not
by the dozen, but by the million. Moreover, out of our four dozen, not
more than some half a dozen are uses that it is worth any one’s while
to register individually in his mind for avoidance. The conclusion of
which is this: we have made no attempt at cataloguing the mistakes of
this sort that must not be committed; every one must construct his own
catalogue by care, observation, and the resolve to use no word whose
meaning he is not sure of—even though that resolve bring on him the
extreme humiliation of now and then opening the dictionary. Our aim has
been, not to make a list, but to inculcate a frame of mind.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neologisms</span></h3>

<p>Most people of literary taste will say on this point ‘It must needs be
that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh’.
They are Liberal-Conservatives, their liberalism being general and
theoretic, their conservatism particular and practical. And indeed, if
no new words were to appear, it would be a sign that the language was
moribund;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> but it is well that each new word that does appear should be
severely scrutinized.</p>

<p>The progress of arts and sciences gives occasion for the large majority
of new words; for a new thing we must have a new name; hence, for
instance, <i>motor</i>, <i>argon</i>, <i>appendicitis</i>. It is
interesting to see that the last word did not exist, or was at least
too obscure to be recorded, when the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> began
to come out in 1888; we cannot do without it now. Nor is there in
the same volume any sign of <i>argon</i>, which now has three pages
of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> to itself. The discoverers
of it are to be thanked for having also invented for it a name that
is short, intelligible to those at least who know Greek, free of
barbarism, and above all pronounceable. As to barbarism, it might
indeed be desired that the man of science should always call in the man
of Greek composition as godfather to his gas or his process; but it
is a point of less importance. Every one has been told at school how
<i>telegram</i> ought to be <i>telegrapheme</i>; but by this time we
have long ceased to mourn for the extra syllable, and begun seriously
to consider whether the further shortening into <i>wire</i> has not
been resisted as long as honour demands.</p>

<p>Among other arts and sciences, that of lexicography happens to have
found convenient a neologism that may here be used to help in the
very slight classification required for the new words we are more
concerned with—that is, those whose object is literary or general,
and not scientific. A ‘nonce-word’ (and the use might be extended to
‘nonce-phrase’ and ‘nonce-sense’—the latter not necessarily, though it
may be sometimes, equivalent to nonsense) is one that is constructed
to serve a need of the moment. The writer is not seriously putting
forward his word as one that is for the future to have an independent
existence; he merely has a fancy to it for this once. The motive may be
laziness, avoidance of the obvious, love of precision, or desire for a
brevity or pregnancy that the language as at present constituted does
not seem to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> to admit of. The first two are bad motives, the third
a good, and the last a mixed one. But in all cases it may be said that
a writer should not indulge in these unless he is quite sure he is a
good writer.</p>

</div>

<p>Mere slips, very likely. If it is supposed that therefore they are not

a writer who allows himself only one such slip in fifty or a hundred
pages; but one who is unfortunate enough to make a second before the
first has faded from the memory becomes at once a suspect. We are
uneasily on the watch for his next lapse, wonder whether he is a
foreigner or an Englishman not at home in the literary language, and
fall into that critical temper which is the last he would choose to be
read in.</p>

<p>The next two examples are quite distinct from these—words clearly
created, or exhumed, because the writer feels that his style requires
galvanizing into energy:</p>

<p>Robbed of the just fruits of her victory by the arbitrary and

</div>

<p>All the specimens yet mentioned have been productions of individual
caprice: the writer for some reason or other took a liberty, or made a
mistake, with one expression; he might as well, or as ill, have done
it with another, enjoying his little effect, or taking his little nap,
at this moment or at that. But there are other neologisms of a very
different kind, which come into existence as the crystallization of
a political tendency or a movement in ideas. <i>Prime Minister</i>,
<i>Cabinet</i>, <i>His Majesty’s Opposition</i>, have been neologisms
of this kind in their day, all standing for particular developments of
the party system, and all of them, probably, in more or less general
use before they made their way into books. Such words in our day are
<i>racial</i>, and <i>intellectuals</i>. The former is an ugly word,
the strangeness of which is due to our instinctive feeling that the
termination <i>-al</i> has no business at the end of a word that is
not obviously Latin. Nevertheless the new importance that has been
attached for the last half century to the idea of common descent as
opposed to that of mere artificial nationality has made <i>a</i>
word necessary. Racial is not <i>the</i> word that might have been
ornamental as well as useful; but it is too well established to be
now uprooted. <i>Intellectuals</i> is still apologized for in 1905
by <i>The Spectator</i> as ‘a convenient neologism’. It is already
familiar to all who give any time to observing continental politics,
though the Index to the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> (1903) knows it not. A
use has not yet been found for the word in home politics, as far as we
have observed; but the fact that intellect in any country is recognized
as a definite political factor is noteworthy; and we should hail
<i>intellectuals</i> as a good omen for the progress of the world.</p>

<p>These, and the scientific, are the sort of neologism that may fairly be
welcomed. But there is this distinction. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> the strictly scientific
words, writers have not the power to decide whether they shall accept
them or not; they must be content to take submissively what the men of
science choose to give them, they being as much within their rights in
naming what they have discovered or invented as an explorer in naming
a new mountain, or an American founder a new city. <i>Minneapolis</i>,
<i>Pikeville</i>, and <i>Pennsylvania</i>, may have a barbaric sound,
but there they are; so <i>telegram</i>, or <i>aestho-physiology</i>.
The proud father of the latter (Herbert Spencer) confesses to having
docked it of a syllable; and similarly Mr. Lecky writes of ‘a
eudaemometer measuring with accuracy the degrees of happiness realized
by men in different ages’; consequently there will be some who will
wish these long words longer, though more who will wish them shorter;
but grumble as we may, the <i>patria potestas</i> is indefeasible. On
the other hand, with such words as <i>racial</i>, <i>intellectuals</i>,
it is open to any writer, if he does not like the word that threatens
to occupy an obviously vacant place, to offer a substitute, or at least
to avoid giving currency to what he disapproves. It will be remembered
that when it was proposed to borrow from France what we now know as
the closure, it seemed certain for some time that with the thing we
should borrow the name, <i>clôture</i>; a press campaign resulted in
<i>closure</i>, for which we may be thankful. The same might have
been done for, or rather against, <i>racial</i>, if only some one had
thought of it in time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Americanisms</span></h3>

<p>Though we take these separately from foreign words, which will follow
next, the distinction is purely <i>pro forma</i>; Americanisms
are foreign words, and should be so treated. To say this is not
to insult the American language. If any one were asked to give an
Americanism without a moment’s delay, he would be more likely than
not to mention <i>I guess</i>. Inquiry into it would at once bear out
the American contention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> that what we are often rude enough to call
their vulgarisms are in fact good old English. <i>I gesse</i> is a
favourite expression of Chaucer’s, and the sense he sometimes gives it
is very finely distinguished from the regular Yankee use. But though
it is good old English, it is not good new English. If we use the
phrase—parenthetically, that is, like Chaucer and the Yankees—, we
have it not from Chaucer, but from the Yankees, and with their, not
his, exact shade of meaning. It must be recognized that they and we,
in parting some hundreds of years ago, started on slightly divergent
roads in language long before we did so in politics. In the details of
divergence, they have sometimes had the better of us. <i>Fall</i> is
better on the merits than <i>autumn</i>, in every way: it is short,
Saxon (like the other three season names), picturesque; it reveals its
derivation to every one who uses it, not to the scholar only, like
<i>autumn</i>; and we once had as good a right to it as the Americans;
but we have chosen to let the right lapse, and to use the word now is
no better than larceny.</p>

<p>The other side of this is that we are entitled to protest when any one
assumes that because a word of less desirable character is current
American, it is therefore to be current English. There are certain
American verbs that remind Englishmen of the barbaric taste illustrated
by such town names as Memphis and those mentioned in the last
section. A very firm stand ought to be made against <i>placate</i>,
<i>transpire</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, and <i>antagonize</i>, all of which have English
patrons.</p>

<p>There is a real danger of our literature’s being americanized, and that
not merely in details of vocabulary—which are all that we are here
directly concerned with—but in its general tone. Mr. Rudyard Kipling
is a very great writer, and a patriotic; his influence is probably the
strongest that there is at present in the land; but he and his school
are americanizing us. His style exhibits a sort of remorseless and
scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> efficiency in the choice of epithets and other words that
suggests the application of coloured photography to description; the
camera is superseding the human hand. We quote two sentences from the
first page of a story, and remark that in pre-Kipling days none of the
words we italicize would have been likely; now, they may be matched on
nearly every page of an ‘up-to-date’ novelist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Between the snow-white cutter and the flat-topped,
<i>honey-coloured</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> rocks on the beach the green water
was troubled with <i>shrimp-pink</i> prisoners-of-war
bathing.—<span class="smcap">Kipling.</span></p>

<p>Far out, a three-funnelled Atlantic transport with turtle bow and
stern <i>waddled</i> in from the deep sea.—<span class="smcap">Kipling.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The words are, as we said, extremely efficient; but the impulse that
selects them is in harmony with American, not with English, methods,
and we hope it may be developed in America rather than here. We cannot
go more fully into the point in a digression like this. But though
we have digressed, it has not been quite without purpose: any one
who agrees with us in this will see in it an additional reason for
jealously excluding American words and phrases. The English and the
American language and literature are both good things; but they are
better apart than mixed.</p>

<p>Fix up (organize), back of (behind), anyway (at any rate), standpoint
(point of view), back-number (antiquated), right along (continuously),
some (to some extent), just (quite, or very—‘just lovely’), may
be added as typical Americanisms of a different kind from either
<i>fall</i> or <i>antagonize</i>; but it is not worth while to make a
large collection; every one knows an Americanism, at present, when he
sees it; how long that will be true is a more anxious question.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

in the pillory. It may be remarked that the latter fits in well enough
with Emerson’s curious bizarre style. Another use of <i>just</i>

<h3><span class="smcap">Foreign Words</span></h3>

<p>The usual protest must be made, to be treated no doubt with the usual
disregard. The difficulty is that some French, Latin, and other words
are now also English, though the fiction that they are not is still
kept up by italics and (with French words) conscientious efforts at
pronunciation. Such are <i>tête-à-tête</i>, <i>ennui</i>, <i>status
quo</i>, <i>raison d’être</i>, <i>eirenicon</i>, <i>négligé</i>, and
perhaps hundreds more. The novice who is told to avoid foreign words,
and then observes that these English words are used freely, takes the
rule for a counsel of perfection—not accepted by good writers, and
certainly not to be accepted by him, who is sometimes hard put to it
for the ornament that he feels his matter deserves. Even with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
best will in the world, he finds that there are many words of which he
cannot say whether they are yet English or not, as <i>gaucherie</i>,
<i>bêtise</i>, <i>camaraderie</i>, <i>soupçon</i>, so that there is no
drawing the line. He can only be told that all words not English in
appearance are in English writing ugly and not pretty, and that they
are justified only (1) if they afford much the shortest or clearest,
if not the only way to the meaning (this is usually true of the words
we have called really English), or (2) if they have some special
appropriateness of association or allusion in the sentence they stand
in. This will be illustrated by some of the diplomatic words given
below, and by the quotation containing the word <i>chasseur</i>.</p>

<p>Some little assistance may, however, be given on details.</p>

<p>1. To say <i>distrait</i> instead of <i>absent</i> or
<i>absent-minded</i>, <i>bien entendu</i> for <i>of course</i>,
<i>sans</i> for <i>without</i> (it is, like <i>I guess</i>, good old
English but not good English), <i>quand même</i> for <i>anyhow</i>,
<i>penchant</i> for <i>liking</i> or <i>fancy</i>, <i>rédaction</i>
for <i>editing</i> or <i>edition</i>, <i>coûte que coûte</i> for <i>at
all costs</i>, <i>Schadenfreude</i> for <i>malicious pleasure</i>,
<i>œuvre</i> for <i>work</i>, <i>alma mater</i> (except with strong
extenuating circumstances) for <i>University</i>—is pretension and
nothing else. The substitutes we have offered are not insisted upon;
they may be wrong, or not the best; but English can be found for all
these. Moreover, what was said of special association or allusion may
apply; to call a luncheon <i>déjeuner</i>, however, as in the appended
extract, because it is to be eaten by Frenchmen, is hardly covered by
this, though it is a praise-worthy attempt at what the critics call
giving an atmosphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was resolved that on the occasion of the visit of the French
Fleet in August the Corporation should offer the officers an

<p>But speaking broadly, what a writer effects by using these ornaments is
to make us imagine him telling us he is a wise fellow and one that hath
everything handsome about him, including a gentlemanly acquaintance
with the French language. Some illustrations follow:</p>

<p>Either we know that <i>tache</i> means stain, or we do not. If we do,
we cannot admire our novelist’s superior learning: if we do not, we
must be doubtful whether we grasp the whole of his possibly valuable
meaning. His calculation is perhaps that we shall know it, and shall
feel complimented by his just confidence in us.</p>

</div>

<p>It is true <i>The Times</i> does not condescend to an Odds-and-Ends,

us against our will the buying of French dictionaries?</p>

<p>2. Among the diplomatic words, <i>entente</i> may pass as suggesting
something a little more definite and official than <i>good
understanding</i>; <i>démenti</i> because, though it denotes the same
as <i>denial</i> or <i>contradiction</i>, it connotes that no more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
credence need be given to it than is usually given to the ‘honest men
sent to lie abroad for the good of their country’; as for <i>ballon
d’essai</i>, we see no advantage in it over <i>kite</i>, and <i>flying
a kite</i>, which are good English; it is, however, owing to foreign
correspondents’ perverted tastes, already more familiar. The words
italicized in the following quotations are still more questionable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The two Special Correspondents in Berlin of the leading morning
newspapers, the <i>Matin</i> and the <i>Écho de Paris</i>, report a
marked <i>détente</i> in the situation.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Entente</i> is comprehensible to every one; but with <i>détente</i>
many of us are in the humiliating position of not knowing whether to be
glad or sorry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the great newspapers have insisted upon the inopportuneness of the
<i>démarche</i> of William II.—<i>Times.</i> (proceeding)</p>

<p>The <i>entourage</i> and counsellors of the Sultan continue to remain
sceptical.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Mere laziness, even if the word means anything different from
<i>counsellors</i>; but the writer has at least given us an indication
that it is only verbiage, by revealing his style in <i>continue to
remain</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In diplomatic circles the whole affair is looked upon as
an <i>acte de malveillance</i> towards the Anglo-French
<i>entente</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>You have been immensely amused, cyrenaically enjoying the moment
for the moment’s sake, but looking before and after (as you cannot
help looking in the theatre) you have been disconcerted and
<i>dérouté</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>In spite, however, of this denial and of other official
<i>démentis</i>, the Italian Press still seems
dissatisfied.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In this there is clearly not the distinction that we suggested between
<i>denial</i> and <i>démenti</i>—the only thing that could excuse the
latter. We have here merely one of those elegant variations treated of
in the chapter ‘Airs and Graces’.</p>

<p>3. It sometimes occurs to a writer that he would like to avail himself
of a foreign word or phrase, whether to make a genuine point or to show
that he has the gift of tongues,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> and yet not keep his less favoured
readers in the dark; he accordingly uses a literal translation instead
of the actual words. It may fairly be doubted whether this is ever
worth while; but there is all the difference in the world, as we shall
presently exemplify in a pair of contrasted quotations, between the
genuine and the ostentatious use. The most familiar phrase thus treated
is <i>cela va sans dire</i>; we have of our own <i>I need hardly
say</i>, <i>needless to remark</i>, and many other varieties; and the
French phrase has no wit or point in it to make it worth aping; we
might just as well say, in similar German or French English (whichever
of the two languages we had it from), <i>that understands itself</i>;
each of them has to us the quaintness of being non-idiomatic, and
no other merit whatever. A single word that we have taken in the
same way is more defensible, because it did, when first introduced
here, possess a definite meaning that no existing English word had:
<i>epochmaking</i> is a literal translation, or transliteration
almost, from German. We may regret that we took it, now; for it will
always have an alien look about it; and, recent in English as it
is, it has already lost its meaning; it belongs, in fact, to one of
those word-series of which each member gets successively worn out.
<i>Epochmaking</i> is now no more than <i>remarkable</i>, as witness
this extract from a speech by the Lord Chancellor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The banquet to M. Berryer and the banquet to Mr. Benjamin,
both of them very important, and to my mind <i>epochmaking</i>
occasions.—<span class="smcap">Lord Halsbury.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The verb <i>to orient</i> is a Gallicism of much the same sort, and
<i>the half-world</i> is perhaps worse:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his quality of eligible bachelor he had no objections at any time
to conversing with a goodlooking girl. Only he wished very much that
he could <i>orient</i> this particular one.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>

<p>High society is represented by ... Lady Beauminster, the half-world
by Mrs. Montrose, loveliness and luckless innocence by her daughter
Helen.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The next extract is perhaps from the pen of a French-speaker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> trying
to write English: but it is not worse than what the English writer who
comes below him does deliberately:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our enveloping movement, which has been proceeding <i>since several
days</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Making every allowance for special circumstances, the manner in which
these amateur soldiers of seven weeks’ service acquitted themselves
compels one ‘furiously to think’.—<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A warning may be given that it is dangerous to translate if you do not
know for certain what the original means. To ask what the devil some
one was doing in that <i>gallery</i> is tempting, and fatal.</p>

<p>Appended are the passages illustrating the two different motives for
translation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we could take this assurance at its face value and <i>to the foot
of the letter</i>, we should have to conclude....—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed (<i>a</i>) that <i>literally</i> gives the
meaning perfectly; (<i>b</i>) that <i>to the foot of the letter</i>
is absolutely unintelligible to any one not previously acquainted
with <i>au pied de la lettre</i>; (<i>c</i>) that there is no wit or
other admirable quality in the French itself. The writer is meanly
admiring mean things; nothing could possibly be more fatuous than such
half-hearted gallicizing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I thought afterwards, but it was <i>the spirit of the staircase</i>,
what a pity it was that I did not stand at the door with a hat,
saying, ‘Give an obol to Belisarius’.—<span class="smcap">Morley.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The French have had the wit to pack into the words <i>esprit
d’escalier</i> the common experience that one’s happiest retorts
occur to one only when the chance of uttering them is gone, the door
is closed, and one’s feet are on the staircase. That is well worth
introducing to an English audience; the only question is whether it
is of any use to translate it without explanation. No one will know
what <i>spirit of the staircase</i> is who is not already familiar
with <i>esprit d’escalier</i>; and even he who is may not recognize
it in disguise, seeing that <i>esprit</i> does not mean spirit (which
suggests a goblin lurking in the hall clock), but wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>We cannot refrain from adding a variation that deprives <i>au pied de
la lettre</i> even of its quaintness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tone of Russian official statements on the subject is not
encouraging, but then, perhaps, they ought not to be taken at the
letter.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>4. Closely connected with this mistake of translating is the other
of taking liberties with foreign phrases in their original form,
dovetailing them into the construction of an English sentence when they
do not lend themselves to it. In Latin words and phrases, other cases
should always be changed to the nominative, whatever the government in
the English sentence, unless the Latin word that accounted for the case
is included in the quotation. It will be admitted that all the four
passages below are ugly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The clergy in rochet, alb, and other best

</div>

<p>The intention is again facetious; but the incongruity between a
Latin inflected ablative and English uninflected objectives is a
kind of piping to which no man can dance; that the English <i>in</i>
and the Latin <i>in</i> happen to be spelt alike is no defence; it
is clear that <i>in</i> is here English, not Latin; either <i>in
pontificalibus</i>, or <i>in other pontificalia</i>.</p>

<p>All things considered, I wonder they were not <i>non est</i> long

</div>

<p>Such maltreatment of <i>non est inventus</i>, which seems to have
amused some past generations, is surely now as stale and unprofitable
as <i>individual</i> itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>5. A special caution may be given about some words and phrases that
either are shams, or are used in wrong senses. Of the first kind are
<i>nom de plume</i>, <i>morale</i>. The French for the name that an
author chooses to write under is <i>nom de guerre</i>. We, in the
pride of our knowledge that <i>guerre</i> means war, have forgotten
that there is such a thing as metaphor, assumed that another phrase is
required for literary campaigning, thereupon ascertained the French for
pen, and so evolved <i>nom de plume</i>. It is unfortunate; for we now
have to choose between a blunder and a pedantry; but writers who know
the facts are beginning to reconcile themselves to seeming pedantic for
a time, and reviving <i>nom de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>The French for what we call <i>morale</i>, writing it in italics under
the impression that it is French, is actually <i>moral</i>. The other
is so familiar, however, that it is doubtful whether it would not be
better to drop the italics, keep the <i>-e</i>, and tell the French
that they can spell their word as they please, and we shall do the like
with ours. So Mr. Kipling:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Gaul, ever an artist, breaks enclosure to study the
morale [<i>sic</i>], at the present day, of the British
sailorman.—<span class="smcap">Kipling.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the second class, of phrases whose meaning is mistaken,
we choose <i>scandalum magnatum</i>, <i>arrière-pensée</i>,
<i>phantasmagoria</i>, and <i>cui bono?</i></p>

<p><i>Scandalum magnatum</i> is a favourite with the lower-class novelist
who takes <i>magnatum</i> for a participle meaning <i>magnified</i>,
and finds the combination less homely than <i>a shocking affair</i>.
It is a genitive plural noun, and the amplified translation of the two
words, which we borrow from the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>, runs: ‘Slander of
great men, such as peers, judges, or great officers of state, whereby
discord may arise within the realm’.</p>

<p><i>Arrière-pensée</i> we have seen used, with comic intent but sad
effect, for a bustle or dress-improver; and, with sad intent but comic
effect, for an afterthought; it is better confined to its real meaning
of an ulterior object, if indeed we cannot be content with our own
language and use those words instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><i>Phantasmagoria</i> is a singular noun; at least the corresponding
French monstrosity, <i>fantasmagorie</i>, is unmistakably singular;
and, if used at all in English, it should be so with us too. But the
final <i>-a</i> irresistibly suggests a plural to the valorous writers
who are impressed without being terrified by the unknown; so:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not that such <i>phantasmagoria are</i> to be compared
for a moment with such desirable things as fashion, fine
clothes....—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Cui bono?</i> is a notorious trap for journalists. It is naturally
surprising to any one who has not pushed his classics far to be told
that the literal translation of it is not ‘To what good (end)?’ that is
‘What is the good of it?’ but ‘Who benefited?’. The former rendering is
not an absolutely impossible one on the principles of Latin grammar,
which adds to the confusion. But if that were its real meaning it would
be indeed astonishing that it should have become a famous phrase;
the use of it instead of ‘What is the good?’ would be as silly and
gratuitous as our above-mentioned <i>to the foot of the letter</i>.
Every scholar knows, however, that <i>cui bono?</i> does deserve to
be used, in its true sense. It is a shrewd and pregnant phrase like
<i>cherchez la femme</i> or <i>esprit d’escalier</i>. <i>Cherchez la
femme</i> wraps up in itself a perhaps incorrect but still interesting
theory of life—that whenever anything goes wrong there is a woman at
the bottom of it; find her, and all will be explained. <i>Cui bono?</i>
means, as we said, ‘Who benefited?’. It is a Roman lawyer’s maxim, who
held that when you were at a loss to tell where the responsibility for
a crime lay, your best chance was to inquire who had reaped the benefit
of it. It has been worth while to devote a few lines to this phrase,
because nothing could better show at once what is worth transplanting
into English, and what dangers await any one who uses Latin or French
merely because he has a taste for ornament. In the following quotation
the meaning, though most obscurely expressed, is probably correct; and
<i>cui bono?</i> stands for: ‘Where can the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> story have come from?
why, who will profit by a misunderstanding between Italy and France?
Germany, of course; so doubtless Germany invented the story’. <i>Cui
bono?</i> is quite capable of implying all that; but a merciful writer
will give his readers a little more help:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(Berlin) The news which awakens the most hopeful interest is the
story of a concession to a Franco-Belgian syndicate in the harbour
of Tripoli. There is a manifest desire that the statement should be
confirmed and that it should have the effect of exciting the Italian
people and alienating them from France. <i>Cui bono?</i>—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>6. It now only remains to add that there are French words good in some
contexts, and not in others. <i>Régime</i> is good in the combination
<i>ancien régime</i>, because that is the briefest way of alluding to
the state of things in France before the Revolution. Further, its use
in the first of the appended passages is appropriate enough, because
there is an undoubted parallel between Russia now and France then. But
in the second, <i>administration</i> ought to be the word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Throwing a flood of light upon the proceedings of the existing
<i>régime</i> in Russia.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>He said that the goodwill and friendship of the Milner
<i>régime</i> had resulted in the effective co-operation of the two
countries.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The word <i>employé</i> is often a long, ugly, and unnatural substitute
for <i>men</i>, <i>workmen</i>, or <i>hands</i>, one of which should
have been used in the first two of the passages below. But it has a
value where clerks or higher degrees are to be included, as in the
third passage. It should be used as seldom as possible, that is all:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The warehouses of the Russian Steamship Company here have been set on
fire by some dismissed <i>employés</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>The <i>employés</i> of the Trans-Caucasian line to-day struck
work.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>The new project, Article 17, ordains that all <i>employés</i> of the
railways, whatever their rank or the nature of their employment, are
to be considered as public officials.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Finally, even words that have not begun to be naturalized may be
used exceptionally when a real point can be gained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> it. To say
<i>chasseur</i> instead of <i>sportsman</i>, <i>gun</i>, or other
English word, is generally ridiculous. But our English notion of the
French sportsman (right or wrong) is that he sports not because he
likes sport, but because he likes the picturesque costumes it gives an
excuse for. Consequently the word is quite appropriate in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But the costume of the <i>chasseurs</i>—green velvet, very
Robin-Hoody—had been most tasteful.—<span class="smcap">E. F. Benson.</span></p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">False, Ugly, or Needless Formations</span></h3>

<p>1. As a natural link between this section and the last, the practice
of taking French words and spelling them as English may stand first.
With French words that fill a definite blank in English, the time
comes when that should be done if it can. With some words it cannot;
no one has yet seen his way to giving <i>ennui</i> an English look.
With <i>dishabille</i>, on the other hand, which appears in the
dictionary with spellings to suit all tastes<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, many attempts have
been made. This word, however, well illustrates the importance of one
principle that should be observed in borrowing from French. Unless
the need is a very crying one, no word should be taken that offers
serious difficulties of pronunciation. In <i>déshabillé</i> are at
least two problems (<i>h</i>, and <i>ll</i>) of which an Englishman
fights shy. The consequence is that, though its English history dates
back some centuries, it is very seldom heard in conversation; no word
not used in conversation becomes a true native; and <i>dishabille</i>
is therefore being gradually ousted by <i>négligé</i>, which can be
pronounced without fear. As <i>dishabille</i> is really quite cut
off from <i>déshabillé</i>, it is a pity it was not further deprived
of its final <i>-e</i>; that would have encouraged us to call it
<i>dish-abil</i>, and it might have made good its footing.</p>

<p><i>Naïveté</i> is another word for which there is a clear use;
and though the Englishman can pronounce it without difficulty if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
he chooses, he generally does prefer doing without it altogether
to attempting a precision that strikes him as either undignified
or pretentious. It is therefore to be wished that it might be
disencumbered of its diaeresis, its accent, and its italics. It is true
that the first sight of naivety is an unpleasant shock; but we ought to
be glad that the thing has begun to be done, and in speaking sacrifice
our pride of knowledge and call it <i>naivety</i>.</p>

<p>The case of <i>banality</i> is very different. In one sense it has
a stronger claim than <i>naivety</i>, its adjective <i>banal</i>
being much older in English than <i>naïve</i>; but the old use of
<i>banal</i> is as a legal term connected with feudalism. That
use is dead, and its second life is an independent one; it is now
a mere borrowing from French. Whether we are to accept it or not
should be decided by whether we want it; and with <i>common</i>,
<i>commonplace</i>, <i>trite</i>, <i>trivial</i>, <i>mean</i>,
<i>vulgar</i>, all provided with nouns, which again can be eked
out with <i>truism</i> and <i>platitude</i>, a shift can surely
be made without it. It is one of those foreign feathers, like
<i>intimism</i>, <i>intimity</i>, <i>femininity</i>, <i>distinction</i>
and <i>distinguished</i> (the last pair now banalities if anything
was ever banal; so do extremes meet), in which writers of literary
criticism love to parade, and which ordinary persons should do their
best to pluck from them, protesting when there is a chance, and at all
times refusing the compliment of imitation. But perhaps the word that
the critics would most of all delight their readers by forgetting is
<i>meticulous</i>.</p>

<p>Before adding an example or two, we draw attention to the danger
of accidentally assimilating a good English word to a French one.
<i>Amende</i> is good French; <i>amends</i> is good English; but
<i>amend</i> (noun) is neither:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Triviality and over-childishness and naivety.—<span class="smcap">H. Sweet.</span></p>

<p>Agrippa himself was primarily a paradox-monger. Many of his successors
were in dead earnest, and their repetition of his ingenuities becomes
<i>banal</i> in the extreme. Bercher himself can by no means be
acquitted of this charge of <i>banality</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>It is significant that the only authorities for <i>banality</i> in the
<i>Oxford Dictionary</i> are Sala, Saintsbury, Dowden, and Browning;
but the volume is dated 1888; and though the word is still used in the
same overpowering proportion by literary critics as opposed to other
writers, its total use has multiplied a hundredfold since then. Our
hope is that the critics may before long feel that it is as banal to
talk about banality as it is now felt by most wellbred people to be
vulgar to talk about vulgarity.</p>

<i>distinction</i>.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>And yet to look back over the whole is to feel that in one case only

her proper goal.—<i>Times.</i></p>

tripping.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Formations involving grammatical blunders.</b> Of these the
possibilities are of course infinite; we must assume that our readers
know the ordinary rules of grammar, and merely, not to pass over the
point altogether, give one or two typical and not too trite instances:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My landlady entered bearing what she called ‘her best lamp’
<i>alit</i>.—<span class="smcap">Corelli.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This seems to be formed as a past participle from <i>to alight</i>,
in the sense of to kindle. It will surprise most people to learn that
there is, or was, such a verb; not only was there, but the form that
should have been used in our sentence, <i>alight</i>, is probably by
origin the participle of it. The <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, however,
after saying this, observes that it has now been assimilated to words
like <i>afire</i>, formed from the preposition <i>a-</i> and a noun.
Whether those two facts are true of not, it is quite certain that there
is no such word as <i>alit</i> in the sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> lighted or lit, and
that the use of it in our days is a grammatical blunder.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But every year pleaded <i>stronger</i> and <i>stronger</i> for the
Earl’s conception.—<span class="smcap">J. R. Green.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Comparative adverbs of this type must be formed only from those
positive adverbs, which do not use <i>-ly</i>, as <i>hard</i>,
<i>fast</i>. We talk of <i>going strong</i>, and we may therefore
talk of <i>going stronger</i>; but outside slang we have to choose
between <i>stronglier</i>—poetical, exalted, or affected—and <i>more
strongly</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The silence that <i>underlaid</i> the even voice of the breakers along
the sea front.—<span class="smcap">Kipling.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Lie</i> and <i>lay</i> have cost us all some perplexity in
childhood. The distinction is more difficult in the compounds with
<i>over</i> and <i>under</i>, because in them <i>-lie</i> is transitive
as well as <i>-lay</i>, but in a different sense. Any one who is not
sure that he is sound on the point by instinct must take the trouble
to resolve them into <i>lie over</i> or <i>lay over</i>, &amp;c., which at
once clears up the doubt. A mistake with the simple verb is surprising
when made, as in the following, by a writer on grammar:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I met a lad who took a paper from a package that he carried and thrust
it into my unwilling hand. I suspected him of having <i>laid</i> in
wait for the purpose.—<span class="smcap">R. G. White.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A confusion, perhaps, between <i>lay wait</i> and <i>lie in wait</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am not sure that <i>yours</i> and my efforts would suffice
separately; but yours and mine together cannot possibly fail.</p>
</div>

<p>The first <i>yours</i> is quite wrong; it should be <i>your</i>.
This mistake is common. The absolute possessives, <i>ours</i> and
<i>yours</i>, <i>hers</i>, <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>, (with which
the poetic or euphonic use of the last two before vowels has nothing
to do) are to be used only as pronouns or as predicative adjectives,
not as attributes to an expressed and following noun. That they were
used by old writers as in our example is irrelevant. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> correct
modern usage has now established itself. We add three sentences from
Burke. The relation between <i>no</i> and <i>none</i> is the same as
that between <i>your</i> and <i>yours</i>. In the first sentence,
modern usage would write (as the correct <i>no or but a few</i> is
uncomfortable) either <i>few or no</i>, or <i>few if any</i>, or <i>no
rays or but a few</i>. For the second we might possibly tolerate <i>to
their as well as to your own</i>; or we might write <i>to their crown
as well as to your own</i>. The third is quite tolerable as it is; but
any one who does not like the sound can write <i>and their ancestors
and ours</i>. It must always be remembered in this as in other
constructions, that the choice is not between a well-sounding blunder
and an ill-sounding correctness, but between an ill and a well sounding
correctness. The blunder should be ruled out, and if the first form
of the correct construction that presents itself does not sound well,
another way of putting it must be looked for; patience will always find
it. The flexibility gained by habitual selection of this kind, which a
little cultivation will make easy and instinctive, is one of the most
essential elements in a good style. For a more important illustration
of the same principle, the remarks on the gerund in the Syntax chapter
(p. 120) may be referred to.</p>

<p><i>A-</i> (not) is Greek; <i>moral</i> is Latin. It is at least
desirable that in making new words the two languages should not be
mixed. The intricate needs of science may perhaps be allowed to
override a literary principle of this sort; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> accordingly the
<i>Oxford Dictionary</i> recognizes that <i>a-</i> is compounded with
Latin words in scientific and technical terms, as <i>a-sexual</i>; but
purely literary workers may be expected to abstain. The obvious excuse
for this formation is that the Latin negative prefix is already taken
up in <i>immoral</i>, which means contrary to morality, while a word is
wanted to mean unconcerned with morality. But with <i>non</i> freely
prefixed to adjectives in English (though not in Latin), there can be
no objection to <i>non-moral</i>. The second of our instances is a few
weeks later than the first, and the hyphen has disappeared; so quickly

exceptions. The ugly words <i>racial</i> and <i>coastal</i> themselves
might well be avoided except in the rare cases where <i>race</i> and

the present instances); and they should not be made precedents for

</div>

<p>It is absurd at this time of day to make a fuss about the word. It is
with us and will remain with us, whatever pedants and purists may say.
In such cases <i>obsta principiis</i> is the only hope; <i>reliable</i>
might once have been suppressed, perhaps; it cannot now. But it is
so fought over, even to-day, that a short discussion of it may be
looked for. The objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> to it is obvious: you do not rely a thing;
therefore the thing cannot be reliable; it should be rely-on-able
(like <i>come-at-able</i>). Some of the analogies pleaded for it are
perhaps irrelevant—as <i>laughable</i>, <i>available</i>. For these
<i>may</i> be formed from the nouns <i>laugh</i>, <i>avail</i>, since
<i>-able</i> is not only gerundival (capable of being laughed at), but
also adjectival (connected with a laugh); this has certainly happened
with <i>seasonable</i>; but that will not help <i>reliable</i>, which
by analogy should be <i>relianceable</i>. It is more to the point to
remark that with <i>reliable</i> must go <i>dispensable</i> (with
<i>indispensable</i>) and <i>dependable</i>, both quite old words, and
<i>disposable</i> (in its commoner sense); no one, as far as we know,
objects to these and others like them; <i>reliable</i> is made into a
scapegoat. The word itself, moreover, besides its wide popularity, is
now of respectable antiquity, dating at least from Coleridge. It may be
added that it is probably to the campaign against it that we owe such
passive monstrosities as ‘ready to be availed of’ for <i>available</i>,
which is, as we said, possibly not open to the same objection as
<i>reliable</i>.</p>

them with a new word and then to borrow it from them; for it will be

to such a word is that its having had to wait so long, in spite of
its obviousness, before being made is a strong argument against the
necessity of it. We may regret that <i>injunction</i> holds the field,
having a much less English appearance; but it does; and in language the

<p>A favourite with those allied experimenters in words, Emerson and
Carlyle. A word meaning <i>to make intense</i> is necessary; and there
are plenty of parallels for this particular form. But Coleridge had
already made <i>intensify</i>, introducing it with an elaborate apology
in which he confessed that it sounded uncouth. It is uncouth no longer;
if it had never existed, perhaps <i>intensate</i> would now have been
so no longer, uncouthness being, both etymologically and otherwise,
a matter of strangeness as against familiarity. It is better to form
words only where there is a clear demand for them.</p>

<p>5. <b>Long and short rivals.</b> The following examples illustrate a
foolish tendency. From the adjective <i>perfect</i> we form the verb
<i>to perfect</i>, and from that again the noun <i>perfection</i>;
to take a further step forward to a verb <i>to perfection</i>
instead of returning to the verb <i>to perfect</i> is a superfluity
of naughtiness. From the noun <i>sense</i> we make the adjective
<i>sensible</i>; it is generally quite needless to go forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
<i>sensibleness</i> instead of back to our original noun <i>sense</i>.
To <i>quieten</i> is often used by hasty writers who have not time to
remember that <i>quiet</i> is a verb. With <i>ex tempore</i> ready to
serve either as adverb or as adjective, why make <i>extemporaneous</i>
or <i>extemporaneously</i>? As to <i>contumacity</i>, the writer was
probably unaware that <i>contumacy</i> existed. <i>Contumacity</i>
might be formed from <i>contumax</i>, like <i>audacity</i> from
<i>audax</i>. The Romans had only the short forms <i>audacia</i>,
<i>contumacia</i>, which should have given us <i>audacy</i> as well as
<i>contumacy</i>; but because our ancestors burdened themselves with an
extra syllable in one we need not therefore do so in the other.</p>

<p>The termination <i>-cracy</i> is now so freely applied that it is
too late to complain of this except on the ground of ugliness. It
may be pointed out, however, that the very special ugliness of

our faces by the telltale syllable <i>-eau-</i>; it is to be hoped that
formations similar in this respect may be avoided.</p>

</div>

<p>In sound, there can be no question between <i>vividity</i> with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>

that will not do either, because <i>determinate</i> does not mean
<i>determined</i> in the required sense. A periphrasis, or an adjective

<h3><span class="smcap">Slang</span></h3>

<p>The place of slang is in real life. There, an occasional indulgence in
it is an almost necessary concession to our gregarious humanity; he who
declines altogether to let his speech be influenced by his neighbours’
tricks, and takes counsel only of pure reason, is setting up for more
than man. <i>Awfully nice</i> is an expression than which few could be
sillier; but to have succeeded in going through life without saying
it a certain number of times is as bad as to have no redeeming vice.
Further, the writer who deals in conversation may sometimes find it
necessary, by way of characterizing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> speakers, to put slang in
their mouths; if he is wise he will make the least possible use of this
resource; and to interlard the non-conversational parts of a book or
article with slang, quotation marks or no quotation marks, is as bad
as interlarding with French. Foreign words and slang are, as spurious
ornaments, on the same level. The italics, but not the quotation marks,
in these examples are ours:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But even this situation ‘<i>peters out</i>’, the wife being sent

court, by the actor....—<i>Times.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The effect of using quotation marks with slang is merely to convert a
mental into a moral weakness. When they are not used, we may mercifully
assume that the writer does not know the difference between slang and
good English, and sins in ignorance: when they are, he is telling us,
I know it is naughty, but then it is nice. Most of us would rather be
taken for knaves than for fools; and so the quotation marks are usually
there.</p>

<p>With this advice—never to use slang except in dialogue, and there
as little as may be—we might leave the subject, except that the
suggestion we have made about the unconscious use of slang seems to
require justifying. To justify it, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span> must attempt some analysis,
however slight, of different sorts of slang.</p>

<p>To the ordinary man, of average intelligence and middle-class
position, slang comes from every direction, from above, from below,
and from all sides, as well as from the centre. What comes from some
directions he will know for slang, what comes from others he may not.
He may be expected to recognize words from below. Some of these are
shortenings, by the lower classes, of words whose full form conveys
no clear meaning, and is therefore useless, to them. An antiquated
example is <i>mob</i>, for <i>mobile vulgus</i>. That was once slang,
and is now good English. A modern one is <i>bike</i>, which will
very likely be good English also in time. But though its brevity is
a strong recommendation, and its uncouthness probably no more than
subjective and transitory, it is as yet slang. Such words should not be
used in print till they have become so familiar that there is not the
slightest temptation to dress them up in quotation marks. Though they
are the most easily detected, they are also the best slang; when the
time comes, they take their place in the language as words that will
last, and not, like many of the more highly descended words, die away
uselessly after a brief popularity.</p>

<p>Another set of words that may be said to come from below, since it
owes its existence to the vast number of people who are incapable of
appreciating fine shades of meaning, is exemplified by <i>nice</i>,
<i>awful</i>, <i>blooming</i>. Words of this class fortunately never
make their way, in their slang senses, into literature (except, of
course, dialogue). The abuse of <i>nice</i> has gone on at any rate for
over a century; the curious reader may find an interesting page upon
it in the fourteenth chapter of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> (1803). But
even now we do not talk in books of <i>a nice day</i>, only of <i>a
nice distinction</i>. On the other hand, the slang use makes us shy
in different degrees of writing the words in their legitimate sense:
<i>a nice distinction</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> we write almost without qualms; <i>an awful
storm</i> we think twice about; and as to <i>a blooming girl</i>, we
hardly venture it nowadays. The most recent sufferer of this sort is
perhaps <i>chronic</i>. It has been adopted by the masses, as far apart
at least as in Yorkshire and in London, for a mere intensive, in the
sense of <i>remarkable</i>. The next step is for it to be taken up in
parody by people who know better; after which it may be expected to
succeed <i>awful</i>.</p>

<p>So much for the slang from below; the ordinary man can detect it. He
is not so infallible about what comes to him from above. We are by
no means sure that we shall be correct in our particular attribution
of the half-dozen words now to be mentioned; but it is safe to say
that they are all at present enjoying some vogue as slang, and
that they all come from regions that to most of us are overhead.
<i>Phenomenal</i>, soon, we hope, to perish unregretted, is (at least
indirectly, through the abuse of <i>phenomenon</i>) from Metaphysics;
<i>immanence</i>, a word often met in singular company, from
Comparative Theology; <i>epochmaking</i> perhaps from the Philosophic
Historian; <i>true inwardness</i> from Literary Criticism; <i>cad</i>
(which is, it appears, Etonian for <i>cadet</i>) from the Upper
Classes; <i>psychological moment</i> from Science; <i>thrasonical</i>
and <i>cryptic</i> from Academic Circles; <i>philistine</i> from the
region of culture. Among these the one that will be most generally
allowed to be slang—<i>cad</i>—is in fact the least so; it has by
this time, like <i>mob</i>, passed its probation and taken its place
as an orthodox word, so that all who do not find adequate expression
for their feelings in the orthodox have turned away to <i>bounder</i>
and other forms that still admit the emphasis of quotation marks. As
for the rest of them, they are being subjected to that use, at once
over-frequent and inaccurate, which produces one kind of slang. But the
average man, seeing from what exalted quarters they come, is dazzled
into admiration and hardly knows them for what they are.</p>

<p>By the slang that comes from different sides or from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> centre
we mean especially the many words taken originally from particular
professions, pursuits, or games, but extended beyond them. Among these
a man is naturally less critical of what comes from his own daily
concerns, that is, in his view, from the centre. <i>Frontispiece</i>,
for face, perhaps originated in the desire of prize-ring reporters
to vary the words in their descriptive flights. <i>Negotiate</i>
(a difficulty, &amp;c.) possibly comes from the hunting-field; people
whose conversation runs much upon a limited subject feel the need
of new phrases for the too familiar things. And both these words,
as well as <i>individual</i>, which must be treated more at length
in the next section, are illustrations of a tendency that we have
called polysyllabic humour and discussed in the Chapter <i>Airs and
Graces</i>. We now add a short list of slang phrases or words that can
most of them be referred with more or less of certainty to particular
occupations. Whether they are recognized as slang will certainly
depend in part on whether the occupation is familiar, though sometimes
the familiarity will disguise, and sometimes it will bring out, the
slanginess.</p>

<p><i>To hedge</i>, <i>the double event</i> (turf); <i>frontal
attack</i> (war); <i>play the game</i>, <i>stumped</i> (cricket);
<i>to run</i>—the show, &amp;c.—(engine-driving); <i>knock out</i>,
<i>take it lying down</i> (prize-ring); <i>log-rolling</i>,
<i>slating</i>, <i>birrelling</i> (literature); <i>to tackle</i>—a
problem, &amp;c.—(football); <i>to take a back seat</i> (coaching?);
<i>bedrock</i>, <i>to exploit</i>, <i>how it pans out</i> (mining);
<i>whole-hogging</i>, <i>world policy</i> (politics); <i>floored</i>
(1. prize ring; 2. school); <i>the under dog</i> (dog-fighting); <i>up
to date</i> (advertising); <i>record</i>—time, &amp;c.—(athletics);
<i>euchred</i>, <i>going one better</i>, <i>going Nap.</i> (cards);
<i>to corner</i>—a thing—(commerce)—a person—(ratting); <i>chic</i>
(society journalism); <i>on your own</i>, <i>of sorts</i>, <i>climb
down</i>, <i>globetrotter</i>, <i>to laze</i> (perhaps not assignable).</p>

<p>Good and sufficient occasions will arise—rarely—for using most of
these phrases and the rest of the slang vocabulary. To those, however,
who desire that what they write may endure it is suggested that, as
style is the great antiseptic, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> slang is the great corrupting
matter; it is perishable itself, and infects what is round it—the
catchwords that delight one generation stink in the nostrils of the
next; <i>individual</i>, which almost made the fortune of many a
Victorian humorist, is one of the modern editor’s shibboleths for
detecting the unfit. And even those who regard only the present will
do well to remember that in literature as elsewhere there are as many
conservatives as progressives, as many who expect their writers to
say things a little better than they could do themselves as who are
flattered by the proof that one man is no better than another.</p>

<p>No treatment of slang, however short, should omit the reminder that
slang and idiom are hard to distinguish, and yet, in literature,
slang is bad, and idiom good. We said that slang was perishable; the
fact is that most of it perishes; but some survives and is given the
idiomatic franchise; ‘when it doth prosper, none dare call it’ slang.
The idiomatic writer differs chiefly from the slangy in using what was
slang and is now idiom; of what is still slang he chooses only that
part which his insight assures him has the sort of merit that will
preserve it. In a small part of their vocabulary the idiomatic and the
slangy will coincide, and be therefore confused by the undiscerning.
The only advice that can be given to novices uncertain of their own
discrimination is to keep carefully off the debatable ground. Full
idiom and full slang are as far apart as virtue and vice; and yet</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Particular Words</span></h3>

<p>Individual, mutual, unique, aggravating.</p>

<p>To use <i>individual</i> wrongly in the twentieth century stamps a
writer, more definitely than almost any other single solecism, not as
being generally ignorant or foolish, but as being without the literary
sense. For the word has been pilloried time after time; every one who
is interested in style at all—which includes every one who aspires to
be readable—must at least be aware that there is some mystery about
the word, even if he has not penetrated it. He has, therefore, two
courses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> open to him: he may leave the word alone; or he may find out
what it means; if he insists on using it without finding out, he will
commit himself. The adjectival use of it presents no difficulty; the
adjective, as well as the adverb <i>individually</i>, is always used
rightly if at all; it is the noun that goes wrong. An <i>individual</i>
is not simply a person; it is a single, separate, or private person,
a person as opposed to a combination of persons; this qualification,
this opposition, must be effectively present to the mind, or the word
is not in place. In the nineteenth, especially the early nineteenth
century, this distinction was neglected; mainly under the impulse of
‘polysyllabic humour’, the word, which does mean <i>person</i> in some
sort of way, was seized upon as a facetious substitute for it; not only
that; it spread even to good writers who had no facetious intention; it
became the kind of slang described in the last section, which is highly
popular until it suddenly turns disgusting. In reading many of these
writers we feel that we must make allowances for them on this point;
they only failed to be right when every one else was wrong. But we, if
we do it, sin against the light.</p>

<p>To leave no possible doubt about the distinction, we shall give many
examples, divided into (1) right uses, (2) wrong uses, (3) sentences in
which, though the author has used the word rightly, a perverse reader
might take it wrongly. It will be observed that in (1) to substitute
<i>man</i> or <i>person</i> would distinctly weaken the sense; in
the sentence from Macaulay it would be practically impossible. The
words italicized are those that prove the contrast with bodies, or
organizations, to have been present to the writer’s mind, though it
may often happen that he does not actually show it by specific mention
of them. On the other hand, in (2) <i>person</i> or <i>man</i> or
<i>he</i> might always be substituted without harm to the sense,
though sometimes a more exact word (not <i>individual</i>) might be
preferable. In (3) little difference would be made by the substitution.</p>

</div>

<p>Some apology is due for so heaping up instances of the same thing; but
here, as with other common blunders to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> treated of later, it has
seemed that an effect might be produced by mere iteration.</p>

<p>The word <i>mutual</i> requires caution. As with <i>individual</i>,
any one who is not prepared to clear his ideas upon its meaning will
do well to avoid it; it is a very telltale word, readily convicting
the unwary, and on the other hand it may quite easily be done without.
Every one knows by now that <i>our mutual friend</i> is a solecism.
<i>Mutual</i> implies an action or relation between two or more persons
or things, A doing or standing to B as B does or stands to A. Let A
and B be the persons indicated by <i>our</i>, C the <i>friend</i>. No
such reciprocal relation is here implied between A and B (who for all
we know may be enemies), but only a separate, though similar relation
between each of them and C. There is no such thing as a mutual friend
in the singular; but the phrase <i>mutual friends</i> may without
nonsense be used to describe either A and C, B and C, or, if A and B
happen to be also friends, A and B and C. <i>Our mutual friend</i> is
nonsense; <i>mutual friends</i>, though not nonsense, is bad English,
because it is tautological. It takes two to make a friendship, as
to make a quarrel; and therefore all friends are mutual friends,
and <i>friends</i> alone means as much as <i>mutual friends</i>.
<i>Mutual wellwishers</i> on the other hand is good English as well
as good sense, because it is possible for me to be a man’s wellwisher
though he hates me. Mutual love, understanding, insurance, benefits,
dislike, mutual benefactors, backbiters, abettors, may all be correct,
though they are also sometimes used incorrectly, like <i>our mutual
friend</i>, where the right word would be <i>common</i>.</p>

<p>Further, it is to be carefully observed that the word <i>mutual</i>
is an equivalent in meaning, and sometimes a convenient one for
grammatical reasons, of the pronoun <i>each other</i> with various
prepositions. To use it as well as <i>each other</i> is even
more clearly tautological than the already mentioned <i>mutual
friendship</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If this be the case, much of the lost mutual understanding and unity
of feeling may be restored.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Correct, if <i>mutual</i> is confined to <i>understanding</i>: they no
longer understand <i>each other</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once their differences removed, both felt that in presence of certain
incalculable factors in Europe it would be of mutual advantage to draw
closer together.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Slightly clumsy; but it means that they would get advantage <i>from
each other</i> by drawing together, and may stand.</p>

<p>... conversing with his Andalusian lady-love in rosy whispers

<p>There may be, moreover, while each has the key of the fellow breast, a

would have done; or <i>mutually sensitive nerves</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now definitely announced that King Edward will meet President
Loubet this afternoon near Paris. Our Paris Correspondent says the
meeting will take place by mutual desire.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Right or wrong according to what is meant by <i>desire</i>. (1) If it
means that King Edward and M. Loubet desired, that is, had a yearning
for, each other, it is correct; but the writer probably did not intend
so poetic a flight. (2) If it means that they merely desired a meeting,
it is wrong, exactly as <i>our mutual friend</i> is wrong. The relation
is not one between A and B; it is only that A and B hold separately the
same relation to C, the meeting. It should be <i>common desire</i>.
(3) If <i>desire</i> is here equivalent to <i>request</i>, and each
is represented as having requested the other to meet him, it is again
correct; but only politeness to the writer would induce any one to take
this alternative.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The carpenter holds the hammer in one hand, the nail in the other, and

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Wrong. The hands are not <i>busy</i> with or <i>upon each other</i>,
but with or upon the work. As <i>commonly</i> would be ambiguous here,
<i>equally</i> or <i>alike</i> should be used, or simply <i>both</i>.
<i>Mutually serviceable</i>, again, would have been right.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There were other means of communication between Claribel
and her new prophet. Books were mutually lent to each
other.—<span class="smcap">Beaconsfield.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This surprising sentence means that Vanity Fair was lent to Paradise
Lost, and Paradise Lost to Vanity Fair. If we further assume for
politeness’ sake that <i>mutually</i> is not mere tautology with <i>to
each other</i>, the only thing left for it to mean is <i>by each
other</i>. The doubt then remains whether (1) Paradise Lost was lent
to Vanity Fair by Paradise Lost, and Vanity Fair to Paradise Lost by
Vanity Fair, or (2) Paradise Lost was lent to Vanity Fair by Vanity
Fair, and Vanity Fair to Paradise Lost by Paradise Lost. This may be
considered captious; but we still wish the author had said either, They
lent each other books, or, Books were lent by them to each other.</p>

<p>A thing is <i>unique</i>, or not unique; there are no degrees of
uniqueness; nothing is ever somewhat or rather unique, though many
things are almost or in some respects unique. The word is a member of
a depreciating series. <i>Singular</i> had once the strong meaning
that <i>unique</i> has still in accurate but not in other writers. In
consequence of slovenly use, <i>singular</i> no longer means singular,
but merely remarkable; it is worn out; before long <i>rather unique</i>
will be familiar; <i>unique</i>, that is, will be worn out in turn,
and we shall have to resort to <i>unexampled</i> and keep that clear
of qualifications as long as we can. Happily it is still admitted that
sentences like the three given below are solecisms; they contain a
self-contradiction. For the other regrettable use of <i>unique</i>,
as when the advertisement columns offer us what they call <i>unique
opportunities</i>, it may generally be assumed with safety that they
are lying; but lying is not in itself a literary offence, so that with
these we have nothing to do.</p>

<p>To <i>aggravate</i> is not to annoy or enrage (a person), but to make
worse (a condition or trouble). The active participle should very
rarely, and the rest of the active practically never, be used without
an expressed object, and that of the right kind. In the sentence, <i>An
aggravating circumstance was that the snow was dirty</i>, the meaning
is not that the dirt was annoying, but that it added to some other
misery previously expressed or implied. But, as the dirt happens to
be annoying also, this use is easily misunderstood, and is probably
the origin of the notorious vulgarism; since it almost inevitably
lays a writer open to suspicion, it is best avoided. Of the following
quotations, the first is quite correct, the other five as clearly
wrong; in the fifth, <i>aggrieved</i> would be the right word.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The Romance languages are those whose grammatical
structure, as well as part at least of their vocabulary, is directly
descended from Latin—as Italian, French, Spanish. Under Romance words
we include all that English has borrowed from Latin either directly or
through the Romance languages. And words borrowed from Greek in general
use, ranging from <i>alms</i> to <i>metempsychosis</i>, may for the
purposes of this chapter be considered as Romance. The vast number of
purely scientific Greek words, as <i>oxygen</i>, <i>meningitis</i>, are
on a different footing, since they are usually the only words for what
they denote.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Case</span></h3>

<p>There is not much opportunity in English for going wrong here,
because we have shed most of our cases. The personal pronouns, and
<i>who</i> and its compounds, are the only words that visibly retain
three—called subjective, objective, possessive. In nouns the first two
are indistinguishable, and are called the common case. One result of
this simplicity is that, the sense of case being almost lost, the few
mistakes that can be made are made often—some of them so often that
they are now almost right by prescription.</p>

<p>1. In apposition.</p>

<p>A pronoun appended to a noun, and in the same relation to the rest of
the sentence, should be in the same case. Disregard of this is a bad
blunder.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But to behold her mother—<i>she</i> to whom she owed her
being!—<span class="smcap">S. Ferrier.</span></p>
</div>

<p>2. The complement with <i>am</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>is</i>, &amp;c., should be
subjective.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am she, she <i>me</i>, till death and beyond it.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>

<p><i>Whom</i> would you rather be?</p>

<p>To how many maimed and mourning millions is the first and sole angel
visitant, <i>him</i> Easterns call Azrael.—<span class="smcap">C. Brontë.</span></p>

<p>That’s <i>him</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>In the last but one, <i>him</i> would no doubt have been defended
by the writer, since the full form would be <i>he whom</i>, as an
attraction to the vanished <i>whom</i>. But such attraction is not
right; if <i>he</i> alone is felt to be uncomfortable, <i>whom</i>
should not be omitted; or, in this exalted context, it might be <i>he
that</i>.</p>

<p>On <i>that’s him</i>, see 4, below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>3. When a verb or preposition governs two pronouns united by
<i>and</i>, &amp;c., the second is apt to go wrong—a bad blunder.
<i>Between you and I</i> is often heard in talk; and, in literature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And now, my dear, let you and <i>I</i> say a few words about this
unfortunate affair.—<span class="smcap">Trollope.</span></p>

<p>It is kept locked up in a marble casket, quite out of reach of you or
<i>I</i>.—<span class="smcap">S. Ferrier.</span></p>

<p>She found everyone’s attention directed to Mary, and <i>she</i>
herself entirely overlooked.—<span class="smcap">S. Ferrier.</span></p>
</div>

<p>4. The interrogative <i>who</i> is often used for <i>whom</i>, as,
<i>Who</i> did you see? A distinction should here be made between
conversation, written or spoken, and formal writing. Many educated
people feel that in saying <i>It is I, Whom do you mean?</i> instead of
<i>It’s me, Who do you mean?</i> they will be talking like a book, and
they justifiably prefer geniality to grammar. But in print, unless it
is dialogue, the correct forms are advisable.</p>

<p>5. Even with words that have no visible distinction between subjective
and objective case, it is possible to go wrong; for the case can always
be inferred, though not seen. Consequently a word should never be so
placed that it must be taken twice, once as subject and once as object.
This is so common a blunder that it will be well to give a good number
of examples. It occurs especially with the relative, from its early
position in the sentence; but, as the first two examples show, it may
result from the exceptional placing of other words also. The mere
repetition of the relative, or insertion of <i>it</i> or other pronoun,
generally mends the sentence; in the first example, change <i>should
only be</i> to <i>only to be</i>.</p>

<p>A recorded saying of our Lord <i>which</i> some higher critics of the

oftentimes the corrupter of a heart not ignoble.—<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Analogous to these are the next three examples, which will require
separate comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Knowledge <i>to</i> the certainty of which no authority could add, or
take away, one jot or tittle.—<span class="smcap">Huxley.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>To</i> is applicable to <i>add</i>, not to <i>take away</i>.
The full form is given by substituting for <i>or</i> ‘and from the
certainty of which no authority could’. This is clearly too cumbrous.
Inserting <i>or from</i> after <i>to</i> is the simplest correction;
but the result is rather formal. Better, perhaps, ‘the certainty of
which could not be increased or diminished one jot by any authority’.</p>

<p>From his conversation I should have pronounced him to be fitted to

</div>

<p>A second <i>in</i> is required. This common slovenliness results from
the modern superstition against putting a preposition at the end. The
particular sentence may, however, be mended otherwise than by inserting
<i>in</i>, if <i>excel</i> is made absolute by a comma placed after
it. Even then, the <i>in</i> would perhaps be better at the end of the
clause than at the beginning.</p>

<p>The italicized <i>upon</i> (we have nothing to do with the other
<i>upon</i>) is right with <i>insist</i>, but wrong, though it must
necessarily be supplied again, with <i>impress</i>. It is the result
of the same superstition. Mend either by writing <i>upon</i> after
<i>insisted</i> instead of before <i>which</i>, or by inserting
<i>which he</i> after <i>and</i>.</p>

<p>6. After <i>as</i> and <i>than</i>.</p>

<p>These are properly conjunctions and ‘take the same case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> after them
as before’. But those words must be rightly understood. (a), <i>I
love you more than him</i>, means something different from (b), <i>I
love you more than he</i>. It must be borne in mind that the ‘case
before’ is that of the word that is compared with the ‘case after’,
and not necessarily that of the word actually next before in position.
In (a) <i>you</i> is compared with <i>him</i>: in (b) <i>I</i> (not
<i>you</i>) is compared with <i>he</i>. The correct usage is therefore
important, and the tendency illustrated in the following examples to
make <i>than</i> and <i>as</i> prepositions should be resisted—though
no ambiguity can actually result here.</p>

<p>But there, I think, Lindore would be more eloquent than
<i>me</i>.—<span class="smcap">S. Ferrier.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It must further be noticed that both <i>as</i> and <i>than</i> are
conjunctions of the sort that can either, like <i>and</i>, &amp;c., merely
join coordinates, or, like <i>when</i>, &amp;c., attach a subordinate
clause to what it depends on. This double power sometimes affects case.</p>

<p>It is to him and such men as <i>he</i> that we owe the
change.—<span class="smcap">Huxley.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This example is defensible, <i>as</i> being here a subordinating
conjunction, and <i>as he</i> being equivalent to <i>as he is</i>. But
it is distinctly felt to need defence, which <i>as him</i> would not;
<i>as</i> would be a coordinating conjunction, and simply join the
pronoun <i>him</i> to the noun <i>men</i>. So, with <i>than</i>:</p>

<i>me</i>, by an inviolable attachment to him from that time

</div>

<p>On the other hand, we could not say indifferently, <i>I am as good as
he</i>, and <i>I am as good as him</i>; the latter would imply that
<i>as</i> was a preposition, which it is not. And it is not always
possible to choose between the coordinating and the subordinating
use. In the next example only the coordinating will do, no verb being
capable of standing after <i>he</i>; but the author has not observed
this.</p>

<p>A difficult question, however, arises with relatives after <i>than</i>.
In the next two examples <i>whom</i> is as manifestly wrong as
<i>who</i> is manifestly intolerable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Dillon, than <i>whom</i> no Englishman has a profounder
acquaintance with....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>It was a pleasure to hear Canon Liddon, than <i>whom</i>, in his day,
there was no finer preacher.</p>
</div>

<p>The only correct solution is to recast the sentences. For instance,
<i>... whose acquaintance with ... is unrivalled among Englishmen</i>;
and <i>... unsurpassed in his day as a preacher</i>. But perhaps the
convenience of <i>than whom</i> is so great that to rule it out amounts
to saying that man is made for grammar and not grammar for man.</p>

<p>7. Compound possessives.</p>

<p>This is strictly the proper place for drawing attention to a question
that has some importance because it bears on the very common
construction discussed at some length in the gerund section. This is
the question whether, and to what extent, compound possessives may be
recognized. Some people say <i>some one else’s</i>, others say <i>some
one’s else</i>. Our own opinion is that the latter is uncalled for and
pedantic. Of the three alternatives, <i>Smith the baker’s wife</i>,
<i>Smith’s wife the baker</i>, <i>the wife of Smith the baker</i>, the
last is unmitigated Ollendorff, the second thrusts its ambiguity upon
us and provokes an involuntary smile, and the first alone is felt to be
natural. It must be confessed, however, that it is generally avoided
in print, while the form that we have ventured to call pedantic is
not uncommon. In the first of the examples that follow, we should be
inclined to change to <i>Nanny the maid-of-all-work’s</i>, and in the
second to <i>the day of Frea, goddess of</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Number</span></h3>

<p>Very little comment will be needed; we have only to convince readers
that mistakes are common, and caution therefore necessary.</p>

<p>1. The copula should always agree with the subject, not with the
complement. These are wrong:</p>

<p>People do not believe now as they did, but the moral
<i>inconsistencies</i> of our contemporaries <i>is</i> no <i>proof</i>
thereof.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It must be remembered that in questions the subject often comes after
the verb and the complement before it; but the same rule must be kept.
E. g., if the last example were put as a question instead of as a
negative statement, ‘What proof <i>is</i> the inconsistencies?’ would
be wrong, and ‘What proof <i>are</i> &amp;c.?’ right.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some sentences in which the subject contains <i>only</i>, a
superlative, &amp;c., have the peculiarity that subject and complement may
almost be considered to have changed places; and this defence would
probably be put in for the next three examples; but, whether actually
wrong or not, they are unpleasant. The noun that stands before the verb
should be regarded as the subject, and the verb be adapted to it.</p>

<p>The next example is a curious problem; the subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> <i>were</i> is

</div>

<p>2. Mistakes in the number of verbs are extremely common when a singular
noun intervenes between a plural subject (or a plural noun between
a singular subject) and its verb. It is worth while to illustrate
the point abundantly; for it appears that real doubt can exist on
the subject:—‘“No one but schoolmasters and schoolboys knows” is
exceedingly poor English, <i>if it is not absolutely bad grammar</i>’
(from a review of this book, 1st ed.).</p>

<p>3. <i>They</i>, <i>them</i>, <i>their</i>, <i>theirs</i>, are often
used in referring back to singular pronominals (as <i>each</i>,
<i>one</i>, <i>anybody</i>, <i>everybody</i>), or to singular nouns
or phrases (as <i>a parent</i>, <i>neither Jack nor Jill</i>),
of which the doubtful or double gender causes awkwardness. It is
a real deficiency in English that we have no pronoun, like the
French <i>soi</i>, <i>son</i>, to stand for <i>him-or-her</i>,
<i>his-or-her</i> (for <i>he-or-she</i> French is no better off than
English). Our view, though we admit it to be disputable, is clear—that
<i>they</i>, <i>their</i>, &amp;c., should never be resorted to, as in the
examples presently to be given they are. With a view to avoiding them,
it should be observed that (<i>a</i>) the possessive of <i>one</i>
(indefinite pronoun) is <i>one’s</i>, and that of <i>one</i> (numeral
pronoun) is either <i>his</i>, or <i>her</i>, or <i>its</i> (One does
not forget <i>one’s</i> own name: I saw one of them drop <i>his</i>
cigar, <i>her</i> muff, or <i>its</i> leaves); (<i>b</i>) <i>he</i>,
<i>his</i>, <i>him</i>, may generally be allowed to stand for the
common gender; the particular aversion shown to them by Miss Ferrier
in the examples may be referred to her sex; and, ungallant as it may
seem, we shall probably persist in refusing women their due here
as stubbornly as Englishmen continue to offend the Scots by saying
<i>England</i> instead of <i>Britain</i>. (<i>c</i>) Sentences may
however easily be constructed (Neither John nor Mary knew <i>his</i>
own mind) in which <i>his</i> is undeniably awkward. The solution is
then what we so often recommend, to do a little exercise in paraphrase
(<i>John and Mary were alike irresolute</i>, for instance). (<i>d</i>)

written in full. Corrections according to these rules will be appended

<h3><span class="smcap">Comparatives and Superlatives</span></h3>

<p>The chief point that requires mention is ill treatment of <i>the
more</i>. In this phrase <i>the</i> is not the article, but an adverb,
either relative or demonstrative. In <i>the more the merrier</i> it
is first relative and then demonstrative: by-how-much we are more,
by-so-much we shall be merrier. When the relative <i>the</i> is used,
it should always be answered regularly by, or itself answer, the
demonstrative <i>the</i>. Attempts to vary the formula are generally
unhappy; for instance,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was leaving his English business in the hands of Bilton, who seemed

Benson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This should run, perhaps: <i>whose efficiency impressed him the more,
the more he knew him</i>—though it must be confessed that the double
form is nearly always uncomfortable if it has not the elbowroom of
a whole sentence to itself. That, however, is rather a question of
style than of syntax; and other examples will accordingly be found
in the section of the Chapter <i>Airs and Graces</i> concerned with
originality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The farther we advance into it, we see confusion more and more unfold
itself into order.—<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Most readers will feel that this is an uncomfortable compromise between
<i>The farther we advance the more do we see</i> and <i>As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> we advance
we see confusion more and more unfold itself</i>. Similarly,</p>

<p>She had reflection enough to foresee, that the longer she countenanced
his passion, her own heart would be more and more irretrievably
engaged.—<span class="smcap">Smollett.</span></p>
</div>

<p>But it is when the demonstrative is used alone with no corresponding
relative clause—a use in itself quite legitimate—that real blunders
occur. It seems sometimes to be thought that <i>the more</i> is merely
a more imposing form of <i>more</i>, and is therefore better suited
for a dignified or ambitious style; but it has in fact a perfectly
definite meaning, or rather two; and there need never be any doubt
whether <i>more</i> or <i>the more</i> is right. One of the meanings is
a slight extension of the other. (1) The correlative meaning <i>by so
much</i> may be kept, though the relative clause, instead of formally
corresponding and containing <i>the</i> (meaning <i>by how much</i>)
and a comparative, takes some possibly quite different shape. But it
must still be clear from the context what the relative clause might be.
Thus, ‘We shall be a huge crowd’.—‘Well, we shall be the merrier’. Or,
‘If he raises his demands, I grant them the more willingly’, i. e., The
more he asks, the more willingly I give. This instance leads to the
other possible meaning, which is wider. (2) The original meaning of the
demonstrative <i>the</i> is simply <i>by that</i>; this in the complete
double form, and often elsewhere, has the interpretation, limited to
quantity, of <i>by so much</i>, or <i>in that proportion</i>; but it
may also mean <i>on that account</i>, when the relative clause is not
present. Again, however, the context must answer plainly in some form
the question <i>On what account?</i> Thus, He has done me many good
turns; but I do not like him any the better; i. e., any better on that
account; i. e., on account of the good turns.</p>

<p>The function of <i>the</i>, then, is to tell us that there is, just
before or after, an answer to one of the questions, <i>More by what
amount?</i> <i>More on what account?</i> If there is no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> answer,
we may be sure that the comparative has no right to its <i>the</i>. We
start with a sentence that is entitled to its <i>the</i>, but otherwise
unidiomatic.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The less</i> is <i>less on that account</i>, viz., that we are
reminded. But the preposition required when the cause is given in
this construction by a noun is <i>for</i>, not <i>by</i>. Read <i>for
the reminder</i>. The type is shown in <i>None the better for seeing
you</i>. Our sentence is in fact a mixture between <i>Our depression
is not lessened</i> by <i>the reminder</i>, and <i>We are not the less
depressed for the reminder</i>; and the confusion is the worse that
<i>depressed by</i> happens to be a common phrase.</p>

<p><i>The</i> tells us that we can by looking about us find an answer
either to <i>Not less true by what amount?</i> or to <i>Not less true

less true about the friends in proportion as it was truer about Mr.
Sowerby</i>; and none to the second except <i>Not less true about
the friends because it was true about Mr. Sowerby</i>. Both are
meaningless, and <i>the</i> the is superfluous and wrong.</p>

<p>Yet as his criticism is more valuable than that of other men, so it is

<p>This is such an odd tangle of the two formulae <i>as ... so</i>,
<i>the more ... the more</i>, that the reader is tempted to cut the
knot and imagine what is hardly possible, that <i>the</i> is meant
for the ordinary article, agreeing with <i>kind of criticism</i>
understood between <i>the</i> and <i>more</i>. Otherwise it must be
cured either by omitting <i>the</i>, or by writing <i>The more valuable
his criticism, the more rarely is it met with</i>. If the latter is
done, <i>than that of other men</i> will have to go. Which suggests
the further observation that <i>the</i> with a comparative is almost
always wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> when a <i>than</i>-clause is appended. This is because
in the full double clause there is necessarily not a fixed standard of
comparison, but a sliding scale. The following example, not complicated
by any <i>the</i>, will make the point clear:</p>

of time in the past, whichever it was, at which you were most averse.
But to be more and more averse is to be more averse at each stage
than at each previous stage. Just such a sliding scale is essential
with <i>the more ... the more</i>. And perhaps it becomes so closely
associated with the phrase that the expression of a fixed standard of
comparison, such as is inevitably set up by a <i>than</i>-clause, is
felt to be impossible even when the demonstrative <i>the</i> stands
alone. In the next two examples, answers to the question <i>More on
what account?</i> can be found, though they are so far disguised
that the sentences would be uncomfortable, even if what makes them
impossible were absent. That is the addition of the <i>than</i>-clause
in each.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>the</i> might pass if <i>than Australia</i> were omitted, and
there would be no objection to it if we read further (for <i>in the
case</i>) <i>if we take the case</i>, and better still, placed that
clause first in the sentence: Nor, if we take the case of Canada,
is the way any the more open. <i>The</i> then means <i>on that
account</i>, viz., because we have substituted Canada.</p>

<p>I would humbly protest against setting up any standard of Christianity
by the regularity of people’s attendance at church or chapel. I am
certain personally that I have a far greater realization of the
goodness of God to all creation; I am certain that I can <i>the
more</i> acknowledge His unbounded love for all He has made, and our
entire dependence on Him, <i>than I could</i> twenty years ago, when I
attended church ten times where I now go once.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>In this, the answer to <i>More on what account?</i> is possibly implied
in the last clause; it would perhaps be, if clearly put, Because I
go to church seldomer. The right form would be, <i>I can the more
acknowledge ... for going</i> (or <i>that I go</i>) <i>to church
only once where twenty years ago I went ten times</i>. Unless the
<i>than</i>-clause is got rid of, we ought to have <i>more</i> without
<i>the</i>.</p>

<p>This question of <i>the</i> is important for lucidity, is rather
difficult, and has therefore had to be treated at length. The other
points that call for mention are quite simple; they are illogicalities
licensed by custom, but perhaps better avoided. Avoidance, however,
that proclaims itself is not desirable; to set readers asking ‘Who are
you, pray, that the things everybody says are not good enough for you?’
is bad policy; ‘in vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte.’ But if a
way round presents itself that does not at once suggest an assumption
of superiority, so much the better.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Relatives</span></h3>

<p><b>a. Defining and non-defining relative clauses.</b></p>

<p>For the purposes of b. and c. below, all relative clauses are divided
into defining and non-defining. The exact sense in which we use these
terms is illustrated by the following groups, of which (i) contains
defining clauses, (ii) non-defining.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(i) The man who called yesterday left no address.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovelace has seen divers apartments at Windsor: but not one, he
says, that he thought fit for me.—<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p>

<p>(ii) At the first meeting, which was held yesterday, the chair....</p>

<p>Deputies must be elected by the Zemstvos, which must be extended and
popularized, but not on the basis of....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>The Emperor William, who was present ..., listened to a loyal
address.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Jones, who should know something of the matter, thinks differently.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The function of a defining relative clause is to limit the application
of the antecedent; where that is already precise, a defining clause
is not wanted. The limitation can be effected in more than one way,
according to the nature of the antecedent. As a rule, the antecedent
gives us a class to select from, the defining clause enables us to make
the selection. Thus in our first example the antecedent leaves us to
select from the general class of ‘men’, the defining clause fixes the
particular man (presumably the only man, or the only man that would
occur in the connexion) ‘who called yesterday’. Sometimes, however, the
functions of the two are reversed. When we have an antecedent with a
superlative, or other word of exclusive or comprehensive meaning, such
as ‘all’, ‘only’, ‘any’, we know already how to make our selection,
and only wait for the relative clause to tell us from what class to
make it. We know that we are to choose ‘the best novel’: the relative
clause limits us to the works of Trollope. We are to choose ‘any man’
we like, provided (says our relative clause) that he ‘knows three
words of Greek’. In either case, the work of definition is done by the
exclusion (implied in the relative clause) of persons or things that
the antecedent by itself might be taken to include.</p>

<p>The point to notice is that, whichever way the defining clause does its
work, it is essential to and inseparable from its antecedent. If for
any reason we wish to get rid of it, we can only do so by embodying its
contents in the antecedent: ‘The man in Paris with whom I correspond’
must become ‘My Paris correspondent’. To remove the clause altogether
is to leave the antecedent with either no meaning or a wrong one. Even
in such extreme cases as ‘the wisest man that ever lived’, ‘the meanest
flower that blows’, where the defining clause may seem otiose and
therefore detachable, we might claim that future wise men, and past and
future flowers, are excluded; but we shall better realize the writer’s
intention if we admit that these clauses are only a pretence of
limitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> designed to exclude the reality; it is as if the writers,
invited to set limits to their statements, had referred us respectively
to Time and Space.</p>

<p>This fact, that the removal of a defining clause destroys the meaning
of the antecedent, supplies an infallible test for distinguishing
between the defining and the non-defining clause: the latter can
always, the former never, be detached without disturbing the truth of
the main predication. A non-defining clause gives independent comment,
description, explanation, anything but limitation of the antecedent;
it can always be rewritten either as a parenthesis or as a separate
sentence, and this is true, however essential the clause may be to the
point of the main statement. ‘Jones’, in our last example above, is
quoted chiefly as one ‘who should know something of the matter’; but
this need not prevent us from writing: ‘Jones thinks differently; and
he should know something of the matter’.</p>

<p>To find, then, whether a clause defines or does not define, remove it,
and see whether the statement of which it formed a part is unaltered:
if not, the clause defines. This test can be applied without difficulty
to all the examples given above. It is true that we sometimes get
ambiguous cases: after removing the relative clause, we cannot always
say whether the sense has been altered or not. That means, however,
not that our test has failed, but that the clause is actually capable
of performing either function, and that the main sentence can bear
two distinct meanings, between which even context may not enable us
to decide. The point is illustrated, in different degrees, by the
following examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. H. Lewis then brought forward an amendment, which had been put
down by Mr. Trevelyan and which provided for an extension of the
process of income-tax graduation.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>This was held to portend developments that somehow or other have not
followed.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The former of these is quite ambiguous. The bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> forward of an
amendment (no matter what or whose) may be all that the writer meant
to tell us of in the first instance; the relative clauses are then
non-defining clauses of description. On the other hand, both clauses
may quite well be meant to define; and it is even possible that the
second is meant to define, and the first not, though the coordination
is then of a kind that we shall show under c. to be improper.
Similarly, in the second sentence, ‘to portend developments’ may
possibly be complete in itself; the whole might then be paraphrased
thus: ‘It was thought that the matter would not stop there: but it
has’. More probably the clause is meant to define: ‘It was held to
portend what have since proved to be unrealized developments’. This
view is confirmed, as we shall see, both by the use of ‘that’ (not
‘which’) and by the absence of a comma before it.</p>

<p>Punctuation is a test that would not always be applicable even if all
writers could be assumed to punctuate correctly; but it is often a
guide to the writer’s intention. For (1) a non-defining clause should
always be separated from the antecedent by a stop; (2) a defining
clause should never be so separated unless it is either preceded by a
parenthesis indicated by stops, or coordinated with a former defining
clause or with adjectives belonging to the antecedent; as in the
following examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The only circumstance, in fact, that could justify such a course....</p>

<p>It is he only who does this, who follows them into all their
force and matchless grace, that does or can feel their full
value.—<span class="smcap">Hazlitt.</span></p>

<p>Perfect types, that satisfy all these requirements, are not to be
looked for.</p>
</div>

<p>It will occur to the reader that our last two examples are strictly
speaking exceptions to the rule of defining clauses, since they tell us
only what is already implied, and could therefore be removed without
impairing the sense. That is true to some extent of many parallel
defining clauses: they are admissible, however, if, without actually
giving any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> limitation themselves, they make more clear a limitation
already given or implied; if, in fact, they are offered as alternative
versions or as reminders. Our next example is of a defining clause of
the same kind:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This estimate which he gives, is the great groundwork of his plan for
the national redemption.—<span class="smcap">Burke.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The limitation given by ‘this’ is repeated in another form by the
relative clause. ‘This estimate, the one he gives, is....’</p>

<p>The reader should bear in mind that the distinction between the two
kinds of relative is based entirely on the closeness of their relation
to the antecedent. The information given by a defining clause must be
taken at once, with the antecedent, or both are useless: that given by
a non-defining clause will keep indefinitely, the clause being complete
in sense without the antecedent, and the antecedent without the clause.
This is the only safe test. To ask, for instance, whether the clause
conveys comment, explanation, or the like, is not a sufficient test
unless the question is rightly understood; for, although we have said
that a non-defining clause conveys comment and the like, as opposed to
definition of the antecedent, it does not follow that a defining clause
may not (while defining its own antecedent) <i>contribute</i> towards
comment; on the contrary, it is often open to a writer to throw his
comment into such a form as will include a defining clause. It may even
appear from a comparison of the two sentences below that this is the
origin of the non-defining clause, (2) being an abbreviation of (1):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Lewis, a man to whom hard work never came amiss, sifted the
question thoroughly.</p>

<p>2. Lewis, to whom hard work never came amiss, sifted the question....</p>
</div>

<p>In (1), a comment is introduced by ‘a man’ in apposition with Lewis; ‘a
man’ is antecedent to a defining relative clause; separate them, and
the antecedent is meaningless. But next remove the connecting words ‘a
man’, and the relative changes at once its antecedent and its nature:
the antecedent is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> ‘Lewis’; the relative is non-defining; and the
clause <i>is</i> a comment, and does not merely contribute to one.</p>

<p><b>b. ‘That’ and ‘who’ or ‘which’.</b></p>

<p>‘That’ is evidently regarded by many writers as nothing more than
an ornamental variation for ‘who’ and ‘which’, to be used, not
indeed immoderately, but quite without discrimination. The opinion
is excusable; it is not easy to draw any distinction that is at all
consistently supported by usage. There was formerly a tendency to use
‘that’ for everything: the tendency now is to use ‘who’ and ‘which’
for everything. ‘That’, from disuse, has begun to acquire an archaic
flavour, which with some authors is a recommendation. De Quincey, for
one, must certainly have held that in exalted prose ‘that’, in all
connexions, was the more dignified relative; his higher flights abound
in curious uses of the word, some instances of which are quoted below.</p>

<p>This confusion is to be regretted; for although no distinction can
be authoritatively drawn between the two relatives, an obvious one
presents itself. The few limitations on ‘that’ and ‘who’ about which
every one is agreed all point to ‘that’ as the defining relative,
‘who’ or ‘which’ as the non-defining. We cannot say ‘My father, that
left Berlin last night, will shortly arrive’, and an examination of
instances would show that we can never use ‘that’ where the clause is
unmistakably non-defining. On the other hand, we cannot say ‘All which
I can do is useless’; this time, it is true, the generalization will
not hold; ‘which’ can, and sometimes must, be used, and ‘who’ commonly
is used, in defining clauses. But that is explained partly by the
obvious inconvenience sometimes attending the use of ‘that’, and partly
by the general tendency to exclude it from regular use, which has
already resulted in making it seem archaic when used of persons, except
in certain formulae.</p>

<p>The rules given below are a modification of this principle, that
‘that’ is the defining, ‘who’ or ‘which’ the non-defining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> relative;
the reason for each modification is given in its place. We must here
remind the reader of the distinction drawn in a. between defining and
non-defining clauses: a defining clause limits the application of the
antecedent, enabling us to select from the whole class to which the
antecedent is applicable the particular individual or individuals meant.</p>

<p>1. ‘That’ should never be used to introduce a non-defining clause; it
is therefore improperly used in all the following examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2. ‘Who’ or ‘which’ should not be used in defining clauses except when
custom, euphony, or convenience is decidedly against the use of ‘that’.
The principal exceptions will be noted below; but we shall first give
instances in which ‘that’ is rightly used, and others in which it might
have been used with advantage.</p>

<p>3. We come now to the exceptions. The reader will have noticed that of
all the instances given in (2) there is only one—the last—in which we
recommend the substitution of ‘that’ for ‘who’; in all the others, it
is a question between ‘that’ and ‘which’. ‘That’, used of persons, has
in fact come to look archaic: the only cases in which it is now to be
preferred to ‘who’ are those mentioned above as particularly requiring
‘that’ instead of ‘which’; those, namely, in which the antecedent is
‘it’, or has attached to it a superlative or other word of exclusive
meaning. We should not, therefore, in the <i>Spectator</i> instance
above, substitute ‘the person that desires’ for ‘who desires’; but we
should say</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The most impartial critic that could be found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The only man that I know of.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Any one that knows anything knows this.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was you that said so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who is it that talks about moral geography?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Outside these special types, ‘that’ used of persons is apt to sound
archaic.</p>

<p>4. It will also have been noticed that all the relatives in (2)
were either in the subjective case, or in the objective without
a preposition. ‘That’ has no possessive case, and cannot take a
preposition before it. Accordingly ‘the man that I found the hat of’
will of course give place to ‘the man whose hat I found’; and ‘the
house in which this happened’ will generally be preferred to ‘the
house that this happened in’. The latter tendency is modified in the
spoken language by the convenient omission of ‘that’; for always in
a defining clause, though never in a non-defining, a relative in the
objective case, with or without a preposition, can be dropped. But few
writers like, as a general rule, either to drop their relatives or to
put prepositions at the end. ‘The friends I was travelling with’, ‘the
book I got it from’, ‘the place I found it in’, will therefore usually
appear as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The friends with whom I was travelling.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The book from which I got it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The place in which I found it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>5. Euphony demands that ‘that that’ should become ‘that which’, even
when the words are separated; and many writers, from a feeling that
‘which’ is the natural correlative of the demonstrative ‘that’, prefer
the plural ‘those which’; but the first example quoted in (2) seems to
show that ‘those ... that’ can be quite unobjectionable.</p>

<p>6. A certain awkwardness seems to attend the use of ‘that’ when the
relative is widely separated from its antecedent. When, for instance,
two relative clauses are coordinate, some writers use ‘that’ in the
first, ‘which’ in the second clause, though both define. This point
will be illustrated in c., where we shall notice that inconsistency in

<p>It may seem to the reader that a rule with so many exceptions to it
is not worth observing. We would remind him (i) that it is based upon
those palpable misuses of the relatives about which every one is
agreed; (ii) that of the exceptions the first and last result from,
and might disappear with, the encroachment of ‘who’ and the general
vagueness about the relatives; while the other two, being obvious and
clearly defined, do not interfere with the remaining uses of ‘that’;
(iii) that if we are to be at the expense of maintaining two different
relatives, we may as well give each of them definite work to do.</p>

<p>In the following subsections we shall not often allude to the
distinction here laid down. The reader will find that our rules are
quite as often violated as observed; and may perhaps conclude that if
the vital difference between a defining and a non-defining clause were
consistently marked, wherever it is possible, by a discriminating use
of ‘that’ and ‘which’, false coordination and other mishandlings of the
relatives would be less common than they are.</p>

<p><b>c. ‘And who’; ‘and which’.</b></p>

<p>The various possibilities of relative coordination, right and wrong,
may be thus stated: (i) a relative clause may be rightly or wrongly
coordinated with another relative clause; this we shall call ‘open’
coordination; (ii) it may be rightly or wrongly coordinated with words
that are equivalent to a relative clause, and for which a relative
clause can be substituted; ‘latent’ coordination; (iii) a clause that
has obviously no coordinate, open or latent, may yet be introduced by
‘and’ or other word implying coordination; for such offenders, which
cannot be coordinate and will not be subordinate, ‘insubordination’ is
not too harsh a term.</p>

<p>The following are ordinary types of the three classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(i) Men who are ambitious, and whose ambition has never been thwarted,
....</p>

<p>Pitt, who was ambitious, but whose ambition was qualified by....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>(ii) Ambitious men, and whose ambition has never been thwarted, ....</p>

<p>An evil now, alas! beyond our power to remedy, and for which we have
to thank the folly of our predecessors.</p>

<p>(iii) Being thus pressed, he grudgingly consented at last to a
redistribution, and which, I need not say, it was his duty to have
offered in the first instance.</p>
</div>

<p>A coordination in which ‘and’ is the natural conjunction may also be
indicated simply by a comma; there is safety in this course, since the
clause following the comma may be either coordinate or subordinate. But
we have to deal only with clauses that are committed to coordination.</p>

<p>‘Insubordination’ will not detain us long; it is always due either to
negligence or to gross ignorance; we shall illustrate it in its place
with a few examples, but shall not discuss it. With regard, however,
to open and latent coordination opinions differ; there is an optimist
view of open coordination, and a pessimist view of latent, both of
which seem to us incorrect. It is held by some that open coordination
(provided that the relatives have the same antecedent) is never wrong,
and by some—not necessarily others—that latent coordination is never
right: we shall endeavour to show that the former is often wrong, and
the latter, however ungainly, often right.</p>

<p>The essential to coordination is that the coordinates should be
performing the same function in the sentence. It is not necessary, nor
is it enough, that they should be in the same grammatical form: things
of the same form may have different functions, and things of different
forms may have the same function. If we say ‘Unambitious men, and who
have no experience’, ‘unambitious’ and ‘who have no experience’ are not
in the same form, but they have the same function—that of specifying
the class of men referred to. Their grammatical forms (vocabulary
permitting) are interchangeable: a defining adjective can always take
the form of a relative clause, and a defining relative clause can often
take the form of an adjective: ‘inexperienced men, and who have no
ambition’. ‘Unambitious’ is therefore the true grammatical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> equivalent
of ‘who have no ambition’, and latent coordination between it and a
relative clause is admissible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, among things that have the same grammatical form,
but different functions, are the defining and the non-defining relative
clause. A non-defining clause, we know, can be removed without
disturbing the truth of the predication; it has therefore no essential
function; it cannot therefore have the same function as a defining
clause, whose function we know to be essential. It follows that open
coordination is not admissible between a defining and a non-defining
clause; and, generally, coordination, whether open or latent, is
admissible between two defining or two non-defining coordinates, but
not between a defining and a non-defining.</p>

<p>Our object, however, in pointing out what seems to be the true
principle of relative coordination is not by any means to encourage the
latent variety. It has seldom any advantage over full coordination;
it is perhaps more apt to lead to actual blunders; it is usually
awkward; and it does violence—needless violence, as often as not—to
a very widespread and not unreasonable prejudice. Many writers may
be suspected of using it, against their better judgement, merely for
the purpose of asserting a right; it is their natural protest against
the wholesale condemnation of ignorant critics, who do not see that
latent coordination may be nothing worse than clumsy, and that open
coordination may be a gross blunder. For the benefit of such critics it
seems worth while to examine the correctness of various examples, both
open and latent; on the other merits and demerits of the latent variety
the reader will form his own judgement.</p>

<p>Wrong: ‘what (that which)’ defines, the ‘and which’ clauses do not.</p>

<p>(ii) <b>Latent coordination</b>, between relative clause and
equivalent, is seldom correct when the relative clause is non-defining;
for the equivalent, with few and undesirable exceptions, is always
a defining adjective or phrase, and can be coordinate only with a
defining clause. The equivalent must of course be a true one; capable,
that is, of being converted into a relative clause without altering
the effect of the sentence. Neglect of this restriction often results
in false coordination, especially in one particular type of sentence.
Suppose that a historian, after describing some national calamity,
proceeds: ‘In these distressing circumstances....’ Here we might seem
to have two possible equivalents, ‘these’ and ‘distressing’. First
let us expand ‘these’ into a relative clause: ‘In the distressing
circumstances that I have described’. This, in the context, is a fair
equivalent, and as often as not would actually appear instead of
‘these’. But next expand ‘distressing’: ‘In these circumstances, which
were distressing’, a non-defining clause. To this expansion no writer
would consent; it defeats the object for which ‘distressing’ was placed
before the antecedent. That object was to record his own sensibility
without disparaging the reader’s by telling him in so many words (as
our relative clause does) that the circumstances were distressing; and
it is secured by treating ‘distressing’ not as a separate predication
but as an inseparable part of the antecedent. ‘Distressing’, it will
be observed, cannot give us a defining clause; it is obviously meant
to be co-extensive with ‘these’; we are not to select from ‘these’
circumstances those only that are ‘distressing’. Moreover, as ‘these’,
although capable of appearing as a relative clause, can scarcely
require another relative clause to complete the limitation of the
antecedent, it follows that in sentences of this form coordination will
generally be wrong. We have examples in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> Cowper quotation below,

<p>These are the instances of false expansion alluded to above. The former
is based on the non-defining expansion ‘in all its moods, which are
varied and capricious’; the true expansion being ‘in all the varied and
capricious moods in which it reveals itself’, a defining clause, which
will not do with the ‘and which’. Similarly, the second is based on the
non-defining expansion ‘in my uncle’s present state, which is an infirm
one’; the true expansion is ‘in the infirm state in which my uncle now
is’. In both, a non-defining clause is coordinated with words that can
only yield a defining clause.</p>

<p>If the writer means us to distinguish, among the innovations introduced

<p>Wrong. ‘A plural substantive’ can yield only the defining clause ‘a

plural subject); and any supplementary defining clause must also be
general, not (like the ‘and which’ clause) particular. We might have,
for instance, ‘Amabant, being plural, and finite, must have for its
subject a plural substantive, and which is in the nominative case’. But
the ‘and which’ clause is evidently non-defining; the inference ends at
‘substantive’; then comes the application of it to the particular case.</p>

that the ‘and which’ clause should define. Now a defining clause must
contain no word that is not meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> to contribute to definition; if,
then, the ‘and which’ clause defines, the writer wishes to distinguish
the religion in question, not only from those European religions that
have not been colonially introduced into America, but also from those
European religions that have been introduced, but whose introduction
is not a matter for regret; that is the only defining meaning that
‘unhappily’ can bear, and unless we accept this interpretation the
clause is non-defining.—We shall allude to this sentence again in

<p>These writers evidently think that in ‘whom we think are hungry’ ‘whom’
is the object of ‘we think’. The relative is in fact the subject of
‘are’; and the object of ‘we know’ is the clause ‘who are hungry’; the
order of the words is a necessary result of the fact that a relative
subject must stand at the beginning of its clause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some writers, with a consistency worthy of a better cause, carry the
blunder into the passive, renouncing the advantages of an ambiguous
‘which’ in the active; for in the active ‘which’ of course tells no
tales.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As to all this, the trend of events has been the reverse of
that which was anticipated would be the result of democratic

</div>

<p>‘Which <i>it</i> was anticipated would be’. Similarly, the passive
of ‘men whom we-know-are-honest’ is the impossible ‘men who
are-known-are-honest’: ‘men who we know are honest’ gives the correct
passive ‘men who it is known are honest’.</p>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that ‘we know’ is parenthetic. In non-defining
clauses (Jones, who we know is honest), we can regard the words as
parenthetic if we choose, except when the phrase is negative (Jones,
who I cannot think is honest); but in a defining clause they are
anything but parenthetic. When we say ‘Choose men who you know are
honest’, the words ‘you know’ add a new circumstance of limitation:
it is not enough that the men should in fact be honest; you must know
them to be honest; honest men of whose honesty you are not certain
are excluded by the words ‘you know’. Similarly, in the <i>Guernsey
Advertiser</i> quotation above, the writer does not go the length of
saying that these are the only gentlemen who would work: he says that
they are the only ones of whom he feels sure. The commas of parenthesis
ought therefore to go, as well as the comma at ‘island’, which is
improper before a defining clause.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which a parenthesis is admissible in a defining
clause may here be noticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>(i) When the clause is too strict in its limitation, it may be modified
by a parenthesis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Choose men who, during their time of office, have never been suspected.</p>
</div>

<p>A whole class, excluded by the defining clause, is made eligible by the
parenthesis.</p>

<p>(ii) Similarly, a parenthesis may be added to tell us that within the
limits of the defining clause we have perfect freedom of choice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Choose men who, at one time or another, have held office.</p>
</div>

<p>They must have held office, that is all; it does not matter when.</p>

<p>(iii) Words of comment, indicating the writer’s authority for his
limitation, his recognition of the sentiments that it may arouse, and
the like, properly stand outside the defining clause: when they are
placed within it, they ought to be marked as parenthetic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are men who, so I am told, prefer a lie to truth on its own

<p>The religion that obtains in Europe, and that, unhappily, has been

</div>

<p>The latter sentence is an adaptation of one considered above on
p. 91. ‘Unhappily’ there appeared not as a parenthesis but as
an inseparable part of the relative clause, which was therefore
defining or non-defining, according as ‘unhappily’ could or could
not be considered as adding to the limitation. But with the altered
punctuation ‘unhappily’ is separable from the relative clause, which
may now define: ‘that obtains in Europe and (I am sorry to have to add)
in America.’</p>

<p>In sentences of this last type, the parenthesis is inserted in
the defining clause only for convenience: in the others, it is an
essential, though a negative, part of the definition. But all three
types of parenthesis agree in this, that they do not limit the
antecedent; they differ completely from the phrases considered above,
which do limit the antecedent, and are not parenthetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p><b>e. Miscellaneous uses and abuses of the relative.</b></p>

<p>(i) A relative clause is sometimes coordinated with an independent
sentence; such coordination is perhaps always awkward, but is not
always incorrect. The question arises chiefly when the two have a
common subject expressed only in the relative clause; for when the
subject is expressed in both, the independent sentence may be taken to
be coordinate, not with the relative clause, but with the main sentence
to which the relative clause is attached, as in the following instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To begin with, he had left no message, which in itself I felt to be a
suspicious circumstance, and (I) was at my wits’ end how to account
plausibly for his departure.</p>
</div>

<p>Retain ‘I’, and ‘I was’ may be coordinate with ‘he had left’: remove
it, and the coordination is necessarily between ‘I was’ and ‘I felt’.
In our next examples the writers are committed:</p>

first two we have a defining, in the third a non-defining relative
clause. A defining clause is grammatically equivalent to an adjective
(‘violated laws’, ‘the popular idea’), and can be coordinated only with
another word or phrase performing the same function; now the phrase ‘we
have been receiving’, not being attached to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> antecedent by means of
a relative, expressed or understood, is not equivalent to an adjective.
We could have had ‘and (which we) have been properly punished <i>for
neglecting</i>’, or we could have had the ‘and’ sentence in an
adverbial form, ‘with the fitting result’; but coordination between the
two as they stand is impossible.</p>

<p>The Burke sentence is a worse offender. Coordination of this kind
is not often attempted when the antecedent of the relative is
<i>subject</i> of the main sentence; and when it is attempted, the two
coordinates must of course not be separated by the predicate. If we
had had ‘the idea which mankind most commonly conceive of proportion,
and very seldom trouble themselves about anything further’, the
coordination would have been similar to the other, and could have
been rectified in the same way (‘and beyond which they very seldom
...’, or ‘to the exclusion of any other considerations’). But this
alteration we cannot make; for there is a further and an essential
difference. The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> writer evidently <i>meant</i>
his second coordinate to do the work of a defining clause; he has
merely failed to make the necessary connexion, which we supply, as
above, either by turning the words into a second defining clause, or
by embodying them, adverbially, in the first. Burke’s intention is
different, and would not be represented by our proposed alteration in
the order. All that a defining clause can do in his sentence is to tell
us <i>what</i> idea is going to be the subject. If we were to give a
brief paraphrase of the whole, italicizing the words that represent
the second coordinate, it would be, not ‘mankind’s <i>sole</i> idea of
proportion is the suitableness ...’, but ‘mankind’s idea of proportion
is the suitableness ..., <i>and very little else</i>’; for the question
answered is, not ‘what is mankind’s sole idea?’ but ‘what is mankind’s
idea?’ In other words, the second coordinate belongs in intention not,
like the relative clause, to the subject, but to the predicate; to
rectify it, we must either make it part of the predicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> (‘and is not
concerned with ...’), or, by inserting ‘they’, coordinate it with the
main sentence. Obvious as the latter correction is, the sentence repays
close examination, as illustrating the incoherence of thought that may
underlie what seems a very trifling grammatical slip.</p>

<p>But in our third example, the relative clause is non-defining; it is
grammatically equivalent to, and could be replaced by, an independent
sentence: ‘Many persons are in the habit of using it’. There is nothing
grammatically wrong in this type of coordination; it is objectionable
only because it seems to promise what it does not fulfil. When the
common subject of two coordinates is expressed only with the first, it
is natural to assume that all words preceding it are also to be applied
to both coordinates; and the violation of this principle, though not
of course ungrammatical, is often felt to be undesirable in other than
relative clauses.</p>

<p>(ii) In the sentences considered above, the antecedent of the relative
did not belong to the second coordinate, and could not have been
represented in it without the material alterations there proposed. But
it may also happen that the antecedent, as in the following examples,
belongs equally to both coordinates, being represented in the first by
a relative, in the second by some other pronoun.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There were two or three <i>whose</i> accuracy was more
scrupulous, <i>their</i> judgement more uniformly sober and
cautious.—<span class="smcap">Bryce.</span></p>

<p>He renewed the old proposal, <i>which</i> Pizarro treated as a piece

<p><i>Which</i> she has it in her option either to do or to let <i>it</i>
alone.—<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the pair of parallel coordinates from Mr. Bryce, insert the
suppressed ‘was’, and it becomes clear that ‘whose’, not ‘their’, is
the right pronoun.</p>

<p>In the ‘Pizarro’ sentence, ‘it’ is not only superfluous, but disturbing
to the reader, who assumes that ‘which’ is common to both clauses, and
on reaching ‘it’ has to glance back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> check the sentence. Here,
as often, the pronoun seems to be added to restore an ill-balanced
sentence; but that can be done in several other ways. In the Richardson
sentence also the ‘it’ should go.</p>

<p>More commonly, the repetition of the antecedent in another form results
from the superstitious avoidance of a preposition at the end:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A demand by Norway for political separation, to which Sweden will not
assent, but will not go to war to prevent it.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>‘To (which)’ is not common to both coordinates: accordingly the writer
finds it necessary to give ‘it’ in the second. But, even if we respect
our superstition, and exclude ‘which Sweden will not assent to, but
will not go to war to prevent’, we have still the two possibilities
of (1) complete relative coordination, ‘to ..., but which ...’; (2)
subordination, ‘though she will not go to war to prevent it’.</p>

<p>In our next example, Lord Rosebery, again for fear of a preposition
at the end, falls into the trap clumsily avoided by the <i>Times</i>
writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That promised land for which he was to prepare, but scarcely to enter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>English trade is carried on upon borrowed capital to an extent of

have conceived.</p>
</div>

<p>(iii) When the relative is the subject of both coordinates, or the
object of both, its repetition in the second is a matter of choice. But
to omit the relative when it is in a different case from the first is a
gross, though not uncommon, blunder. The following are instances:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A league which their posterity for many ages kept so inviolably,
and proved so advantageous for both the kingdoms of France and
Scotland.—<span class="smcap">Lockhart.</span></p>

<p>Questions which we either do not put to ourselves, or are turned aside
with traditional replies.—<span class="smcap">Mark Rutherford.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It is just conceivable that in the last of these the subject of ‘are’
is ‘we’: if so, the sentence is to be referred to (i) above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> (wrong
coordination of an independent sentence with a defining relative
clause).</p>

<p>It is not easy to see why the relative more than other words should be
mishandled in this way; few would write (but see p. 61, s. f.) ‘This
league we kept and has proved advantageous’.</p>

<p>The condensed antecedent-relative ‘what’ is only an apparent exception
to this universal rule. In the sentence ‘What I hold is mine’, ‘what’
is only object to ‘hold’, not subject to ‘is’; the subject to ‘is’ is
the whole noun-clause ‘what I hold’. Sentences of this type, so far
from being exceptions, often give a double illustration of the rule,
and leave a double possibility of error. For just as a single ‘what’
cannot stand in different relations to two coordinate verbs in its
clause, so a single noun-clause cannot stand in different relations to
two coordinate main verbs. We can say ‘What I have and hold’, where
‘what’ is object to both verbs, and ‘what is mine and has been fairly
earned by me’, where it is subject to both; but we cannot say ‘what I
have and has been fairly earned by me’. Similarly, we can say ‘What
I have is mine and shall remain mine’, where the noun-clause ‘what I
have’ is subject to both verbs, and ‘What I have I mean to keep, and
will surrender to no man’, where it is object to both; but not ‘What I
have is mine, and I will surrender to no man’. Of the various ways of
avoiding this error (subordination, adaptation of verbs, insertion of
a pronoun, relative or otherwise), that chosen by Miss Brontë below is
perhaps the least convenient. Her sentence is, however, correct; that
from the <i>Spectator</i> is not.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not mere empty ideas, but what were once realities, and that I long
have thought decayed.—<span class="smcap">C. Brontë.</span></p>

<p>Whatever we possessed in 1867 the British Empire possesses now, and is
part of the Dominion of Canada.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>‘Things that were once realities, and that I long have thought
decayed’; a pair of defining clauses.</p>

<p>The condensed ‘what’ must of course be distinguished from the ‘what’
of indirect questions, which is not relative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> but interrogative. In
the following example, confusion of the two leads to an improper
coordination.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What sums he made can only be conjectured, but must have been
enormous.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the first sentence, ‘what’ is an interrogative, in the second, a
condensed antecedent-relative, standing for ‘the sums that’. It is the
sums that were enormous: it is the answer to the question ‘What sums
did he make?’ that can only be conjectured. The mistake is possible
only because ‘can’ and ‘must’ do not reveal their number: ‘can’ is
singular, ‘must’ plural.</p>

<p>The differentiation between the two <i>what</i>s and their equivalents
is not, indeed, complete: just as the condensed antecedent-relative
resembles in form, though not in treatment, the unresolved
interrogative, so the interrogative, by resolution into ‘the ... that
(which)’, not only resembles, but is grammatically identified with,
the uncondensed relative and antecedent. The resolution is, no doubt,
convenient: it should be noticed, however, that the verbs with which
alone it can be employed (verbs that may denote either perception of
a fact or other kinds of perception) are precisely those with which
ambiguity may result. ‘I know the house (that) you mean’: it may
(antecedent and relative) or may not (resolved interrogative) follow
that I have ever seen it. ‘We must first discover the scoundrel who
did it’; antecedent and relative? then we must secure the scoundrel’s
person; resolved interrogative? then only information is needed.
‘I can give a good guess at the problem that is puzzling you’: and
the solution?—I know nothing of the solution; I was resolving an
interrogative.</p>

<p>This, however, does not affect sentences like the Macaulay one above:
for although the resolved or uncondensed forms (‘the ... which’) are
grammatically identified, the condensed or unresolved forms (‘what’)
are not.</p>

<p>(iv) The omission of the relative in isolated clauses (as opposed to
coordinates) is a question not of correctness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> but of taste, so far
as there is any question at all. A non-defining relative can never be
omitted. The omission of a defining relative subject is often effective
in verse, but in prose is either an archaism or a provincialism. It
may, moreover, result in obscurity, as in the second of our examples,
which may possibly puzzle the reader for a moment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now it would be some fresh insect won its way to a temporary fatal new
development—<span class="smcap">H. G. Wells.</span></p>

<p>No one finds himself planted at last in so terribly foul a morass, as
he would fain stand still for ever on dry ground.—<span class="smcap">Trollope.</span></p>
</div>

<p>But when the defining relative is object, or has a preposition, there
is no limit to the omission, unless euphony is allowed to be one. We
give three instances in which the reader may or may not agree that the
relative might have been retained with advantage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We do that in our zeal our calmer moments would be afraid to

before?—<span class="smcap">Bagehot.</span></p>

<p>These ethical judgements we pass on self-regarding acts are ordinarily
little emphasized.—<span class="smcap">Spencer.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(v) When a defining relative has the same preposition as its
antecedent, it is not uncommon, in the written as well as in the
spoken language, to omit the preposition in the relative clause. There
is something to be said for a licence that rids us of such cumbrous
formulae as ‘in the way in which’, ‘to the extent to which’, and the
like; in writing, however, it should be used with caution if at all.</p>

<p>In the first place, if the preposition is to go, the relative should
go too, or if retained should certainly be ‘that’, not ‘which’; and if
the verb of the relative clause is the same as in the main sentence,
it should be represented by ‘do’, or (in a compound tense) by its
auxiliary component.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because they found that it touched them in a way which no book in the
world could touch them.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>The man who cleaned the slate in the manner which Sir E. Satow has

<p>‘In a way no other book in the world could’: ‘in the way (that) Sir E.
Satow has done’.</p>

<p>A further limitation is suggested by our next example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Great Powers, after producing this absolutely
certain result, are ending with what they ought to have
begun,—coercion.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Here, of course, the relative cannot be omitted, since relative and
antecedent are one. But that is not the principal fault, as will appear
from a resolution of the antecedent-relative: ‘they are ending with
the very thing (that) they ought to have begun ...’. We are now at
liberty to omit our relative or retain it, as we please; in either
case, the omission of ‘with’ is unbearable. The reason is that ‘with’
does not, like the ‘in’ of our former examples, introduce a purely
adverbial phrase: it is an inseparable component of the compound verbs
‘end-with’ and ‘begin-with’, of which the antecedent and relative are
respectively the objects. Similarly, we cannot say ‘He has come to the
precise conclusion (that) I thought he would come’, because we should
be mutilating the verb to ‘come-to’; we can, however, say ‘to the
conclusion (that) I thought he would’, ‘come-to’ being then represented
by ‘would’.</p>

<p>Finally, the omission is justifiable only when antecedent and relative
have the same preposition. Sentences like the next may pass in
conversation, but (except with the one noun <i>way</i>) are intolerable
in writing:</p>

</div>

<p><b>f. ‘It ... that.’</b></p>

<p>Two constructions, closely allied, but grammatically distinct, are
often confused: (i) Antecedent ‘<b>it</b>’ followed by a defining
relative clause with ‘that’ (who, which); (ii) ‘<b>it</b>’ followed
by a clause in apposition, introduced by the conjunction ‘that’. The
various correct possibilities are represented in the set of examples
given below. Relative clauses are marked R, conjunction clauses C. One
impossible example is added in brackets, to mark the transition from
relative to conjunction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) It is money that I want. R.</p>

<p>(2) It was you that told me. R.</p>

<p>(3) It was you that I gave it to (or, to whom I gave it). R.</p>

<p>(4) It was to you that I gave it. C.</p>

<p>(5) It was the Romans that built this wall. R.</p>

<p>(6) It is the Romans that we are indebted to for this. R.</p>

<p>(7) It is to the Romans that we are indebted for this. C.</p>

<p>(8) It was Jones whose hat I borrowed. R.</p>

<p>(9) It was Jones’s hat that I borrowed. R.</p>

<p>(10) It was a knife that I cut it with. R.</p>

<p>(11) It was with a knife that I cut it. C.</p>

<p>(12) It was with difficulty that I cut it. C.</p>

<p>(13) (It was difficulty that I cut it with.) R.</p>

<p>(14) It was provisionally that I made the offer. C.</p>

<p>(15) It was in this spring, too, that the plague broke out. C.</p>

<p>(16) Accordingly, it was with much concern that I presently received a
note informing me of his departure. C.</p>
</div>

<p>In the relative construction, the antecedent ‘it’ is invariable,
whatever the number and gender of the relative. The main verb is also
invariable in number, but in tense is usually adapted to past, though
not (for euphony’s sake) to future circumstances: ‘it was you that
looked foolish’, but ‘it is you that will look foolish’.</p>

<p>In both constructions, the ‘that’ clause, supplemented or introduced by
‘it’, gives us the subject of a predication, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> relative clause (with
<i>it</i>) being equivalent to a pure noun, the conjunction clause to
a verbal noun in apposition, partly retaining its verbal character. In
both, also, the predication answers an imaginary question, recorded
distinctly in the relative, less distinctly in the conjunction clause.
‘What do you want?’ ‘It (the thing) that I want is money.’ ‘To whom did
you give it?’ ‘It (the persons) that I gave it to was your friends.’
‘As to your cutting it: give particulars.’ ‘It—that I cut it (my
cutting it)—was with a knife.’</p>

<p>From the above examples it will be seen that the two constructions
largely overlap. When (as in 1, 2, 5, 8) the relative is subject or
direct object of the clause-verb, or is in the possessive case, it
cannot be replaced by the conjunction; but when its relation to the
clause-verb is marked by a preposition, the conjunction always may take
its place, and sometimes must, as in 12 and 13. For the relative clause
can only be used when the question reflected in it is calculated to
secure the right kind of answer. Now the natural answer to the question
‘What did you cut it with?’ is not ‘difficulty’ but ‘a knife’. The
misleading ‘with’ is therefore removed from the relative clause in
13, and placed within the predicate, the definite question ‘What did
you cut it with?’ giving place to the vague demand for particulars.
‘With’ being removed, the relative clause falls to pieces, for want
of a word to govern the relative, and the conjunction clause takes
its place. In the same way, ‘it was <i>a cab</i> (but not <i>high
indignation</i>) that he drove away in’; ‘it was <i>a concert</i>
(but not <i>curiosity</i>) that I was returning from’; ‘it was a
<i>beech-tree</i> (but not <i>unpleasant circumstances</i>) that I
found him under’. And, generally, it will be found that a preposition
is admissible in the relative clause only when used in the literal or
the most obvious sense.</p>

<p>The conjunction clause is, as we have said, a verbal noun; so far a
noun that things can be predicated of it, and so far a verb that the
things predicated of it are verbal relations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> verbal circumstances,
indirect object, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, attendant
circumstances; anything but subject and direct object. ‘My giving was
to you’; ‘my offering was provisionally’; ‘my concealing it was because
I was ashamed’.</p>

<p>The mistakes that constantly occur in careless writers result from
hesitation between the two forms where both are possible. The
confusion, however, ought not to arise; for always with a relative
clause, and never with a conjunction, the complement of the main
predicate (the answer to the suppressed question) is a noun or the
grammatical equivalent of a noun. ‘A knife’, ‘Jones’, ‘you’, ‘my friend
in Chicago’, ‘the man who lives next door’, are the answers that
accompany the relative clause: ‘with a knife’, ‘with difficulty’, ‘to
you’, ‘occasionally’, ‘because I was ashamed’, are those that accompany
the conjunction.</p>

<p>Examples 15 and 16, though quite recognized types, are really
artificial perversions. In 15 the true question and answer in the
circumstances would be, not, as the sentence falsely implies, ‘When did
the plague break out?’ ‘That too happened in this same spring’, but
‘Were there any other notable events in this spring?’ ‘Yes: the plague
broke out’. Impressiveness is given to the announcement by the fiction
that the reader is wondering when the plague broke out; in fact, he is
merely waiting for whatever may turn up in the history of this spring.
In 16 we go still further: the implied question, ‘What were your
feelings on receiving a (not <i>the</i>) note ...?’ could not possibly
be asked; the information that alone could prompt it is only given in
the ‘that’ clause.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out in b. that a relative clause with antecedent
‘it’ particularly calls for the relative ‘that’, in preference
to ‘which’, and even to ‘who’. Even when the relative is in the
possessive case, ‘that’, which has no possessive, is often retained
by transferring to the main predicate the noun on which it depends; 8
thus gives place to 9, even at the risk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> of ambiguity; for the relative
clause now supplies us with the question (not ‘whose hat ...?’ but)
but ‘what did you borrow?’ leaving us theoretically in doubt whether
Jones’s hat is distinguished from his other property, from other
people’s hats, or from things in general.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the two blunders that are most frequently made
almost invariably have the relative ‘who’ or ‘which’.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And it is to me, the original promoter of the whole scheme, to whom
they would deny my fair share in the profits!</p>
</div>

<p>‘To me’ implies a conjunction clause: ‘to whom ...’ is a relative
clause. ‘It is to me that...’.</p>

</div>

<p>Again a common blunder; not, however, a confusion between the two
constructions above, but between one of them (the relative) and a
third. The sentence explains why every one seems to prefer Shakespeare
to Ouida (they are afraid to say that they like Ouida best). ‘What is
the explanation of this?’ ‘It is not the plentifulness of taste, but
the rarity of courage, that explains it.’ Or, less clumsily, using the
construction that Stevenson doubtless intended: ‘It (the inference to
be drawn) is not that taste is plentiful, but that courage is rare.’</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Participle and Gerund</span></h3>

<p>It is advisable to make a few remarks on the participle and gerund
together before taking them separately. As the word <i>gerund</i>
is variously used, we first define it. A gerund is the verbal noun
identical in form with any participle, simple or compound, that
contains the termination <i>-ing</i>. Thus the verb <i>write</i> has
the active participles <i>writing</i>, <i>having written</i>, <i>being
about to write</i>, <i>about to write</i>, and the passive participles
<i>written</i>, <i>having been written</i>, <i>being written</i>,
<i>about to be written</i>, <i>being about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> be written</i>. Any
of these except <i>written</i>, <i>about to write</i>, <i>about to
be written</i>, may be a gerund also; but while the participle is
an adjective, the gerund is a noun, differing from other nouns in
retaining its power (if the active gerund of a transitive verb) of
directly governing another noun.</p>

<p>Both these are of great importance for our purpose. The participle
itself, even when confusion with the other cannot occur, is much
abused; and the slovenly uses of it that were good enough in Burke’s
time are now recognized solecisms. Again, the identity between the two
forms leads to loose and unaccountable gerund constructions that will
probably be swept away, as so many other laxities have been, with the
advance of grammatical consciousness. We shall have to deal with both
these points at some length.</p>

<p>It is indeed no wonder that the forms in <i>-ing</i> should require
close attention. Exactly how many old English terminations <i>-ing</i>
is heir to is a question debated by historical grammarians, which we
are not competent to answer. But we may point out that <i>writing</i>
may now be (1) participle—I was writing; I saw him writing; writing
piously, he acts profanely—, (2) gerund or full verbal noun—I object
to your writing that—, (3) hybrid between gerund and participle—I
do not mind you writing it—, (4) detached verbal noun—Writing is an
acquired art—, (5) concrete noun—This writing is illegible. Moreover,
the verbal noun <i>writing</i> has the synonym <i>to write</i>,
obligatory instead of it in some connexions, better in some, worse
in some, and impossible in others; compare, for instance: I do not
like the trouble of writing; I shall not take the trouble to write;
the trouble of writing is too much for him; it is a trouble to write;
writing is a trouble. The grammatical difficulties, that is, are
complicated by considerations of idiom.</p>

<p>In these preliminary remarks, however, it is only with the distinction
or want of distinction between participle and gerund that we are
concerned. The participle is an adjective, and should be in agreement
with a noun or pronoun; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> gerund is a noun, of which it should be
possible to say clearly whether, and why, it is in the subjective,
objective, or possessive case, as we can of other nouns. That the
distinction is often obscured, partly in consequence of the history of
the language, will be clear from one or two facts and examples.</p>

<p>1. <i>The man is building</i> contains what we should all now
call, whether it is so or not historically, a participle or verbal
adjective: <i>the house is building</i> (older but still living and
correct English for <i>the house is being built</i>) contains, as its
remarkable difference of meaning prepares us to believe, a gerund or
verbal noun, once governed by a now lost preposition.</p>

<p>2. In <i>He stopped, laughing</i> we have a participle; in <i>He
stopped laughing</i>, a verbal noun governed directly by the verb; in
<i>He burst out laughing</i>, a verbal noun governed by a vanished
preposition.</p>

<p>3. Present usage does not bear out the definite modern ideas of the
distinction between participle and gerund as respectively adjective
and noun. So long as that usage continues, there are various degrees
of ambiguity, illustrated by the three following examples. It would
be impossible to say, whatever the context, whether the writer of the
first intended a gerund or a participle. In the second, a previous
sentence would probably have decided the question. In the third, though
grammar (again as modified by present usage) leaves the question open,
the meaning of the sentence is practically decisive by itself.</p>

</div>

<p>In the second of these, if <i>sitting</i> is a participle, the
meaning is that the end will be secured by the Commission, which is
described by way of identification as the one sitting in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> Paris. If
<i>sitting</i> is gerund, the end will be secured by the wise choice
of Paris and not another place for its scene. If <i>Commission’s</i>
were written, there could be no doubt the latter was the meaning. With
<i>Commission</i>, there is, by present usage, absolutely no means of
deciding between the two meanings apart from possible light in the
context. In the third, common sense is able to tell us, though grammar
gives the question up, that what is interesting is not the other people
who have them, but the question whether other people have them.</p>

<p>We shall, in the section on the gerund, take up the decided position
that all gerunds ought to be made distinguishable from participles. We
are quite aware, however, that in the first place a language does not
remodel itself to suit the grammarian’s fancy for neat classification;
that secondly the confusion is not merely wanton or ignorant, but the
result of natural development; that thirdly the change involves some
inconveniences, especially to hurried and careless writers. On the
other hand it is certain that the permanent tendency in language is
towards the correct and logical, not from it; it is merely hoped that
the considerable number of instances here collected may attract the
attention of some writers who have not been aware of the question,
and perhaps convince them that the distinction is a useful one,
that a writer ought to know and let us know whether he is using a
participle or a gerund, and that to abandon the gerund when it cannot
be distinguished without clumsiness need cause no difficulty to any but
the very unskilful in handling words.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Participles</span></h3>

<p>The unattached or wrongly attached participle is one of the blunders
most common with illiterate or careless writers. But there are degrees
of heinousness in the offence; our examples are arranged from 1. to 8.
in these degrees, starting with perfect innocence.</p>

<p>1. Participles that have passed into prepositions, conjunctions, or
members of adverbial phrases.</p>

that roughly speak, but the moralist; not <i>years</i> that look, but
philosophic historians; not <i>the Bill</i> that assumes, but the
newspaper prophet. The development into prepositions, &amp;c., is a natural
one, however; the only question about any particular word of the kind
is whether the vox populi has yet declared for it; when it has, there
is no more to be said; but when it has not, the process should be
resisted as long as possible, writers acting as a suspensive House of
Lords; an instance will be found in 4.</p>

<p>5. An unwary writer sometimes attaches a participle to the subject of
a previous sentence, assuming that it will be the subject of the new
sentence also, and then finds (or rather is not awake enough to find)
himself mistaken. This is a trap into which good writers sometimes
fall, and so dangerous to bad writers that we shall give many examples.
It is important for the tiro to realize that he has not satisfied the
elementary requirements of grammar until he has attached the participle
to a noun in the same sentence as itself, not in another. He must also
remember that, for instance, <i>I went and he came</i>, though often
spoken of loosely as a sentence, is in fact as fully two sentences as
if each half of it were ten lines long, and the two were parted by a
full stop and not connected by a conjunction.</p>

stopping (<i>thus</i>). With <i>omnibuses</i>? The horses possibly
blame those innocents, but we can hardly suppose a human being, even
the writer of the sentence, so illogical. The word <i>thus</i>,
however, is often considered to have a kind of dispensing power,
freeing its participle from all obligations; so:</p>

<p><b>9. The absolute construction</b> is not much to be recommended,
having generally an alien air in English; but it is sometimes useful.
It must be observed, first, that the case used should now invariably be
the subjective, though it was otherwise in old English. Secondly, it
is very seldom advisable to make an absolute construction and insert a
pronoun for the purpose when the participle might simply be attached
in ordinary agreement to a noun already to hand. Thirdly, it is very
bad to use the construction, but omit to give the participle a noun
or pronoun to itself. These three transgressions will be illustrated,
in the same order, by the next three examples. But many of the wrong
sentences in 5<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> above may be regarded as absolute constructions with
the subject omitted.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Gerund</span></h3>

<p>There are three questions to be considered: whether a writer ought to
let us know that he is using a gerund and not a participle; when a
gerund may be used without its subject’s being expressed; when a gerund
with preposition is to be preferred to the infinitive.</p>

<p><b>1. Is the gerund to be made recognizable?</b> And, in the
circumstances that make it possible, that is, when its subject is
expressed, is this to be done sometimes, or always?</p>

<p>It is done by putting what we call for shortness’ sake the subject of
the gerund (i. e., the word <i>me</i> or <i>my</i> in <i>me doing</i>
or <i>my doing</i>) in the possessive instead of in the objective or
subjective case.</p>

<p>Take the typical sentence: I dislike my best friend(’s) violating
my privacy. It cannot be a true account of the matter to say
that <i>friend</i> is the object of <i>I dislike</i>, and has
a participle <i>violating</i> attached to it. For (a) we can
substitute <i>resent</i>, which never takes a personal object, for
<i>dislike</i>, without changing the sense. (b) If we substitute a
passive construction, also without changing the sense, we find that
<i>dislike</i> has quite a different object—<i>privacy</i>.—I dislike
my privacy being violated by my friend. (c) Many of us would be willing
to adopt the sentiment conveyed who yet would not admit for a moment
that they disliked their best friend even when he intruded; they
condemn the sin, but not the sinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p><i>Violating</i> then is not an ordinary participle. It does not
follow yet that it is a gerund. It may be an extraordinary participle,
fused into one notion with the noun, so that <i>a friend violating</i>
means <i>the-violation-by-a-friend</i>. The Latin scholar here at once
puts in the idiom of <i>occisus Caesar</i>, which does not generally
mean <i>Caesar after he was killed</i>, as it naturally should, but
the killing of Caesar, or the fact that Caesar had been killed. The
parallel is close (though the use is practically confined to the
passive in Latin), and familiar to all who know any Latin at all.
But it shows not so much what the English construction is as how
educated people have been able to reconcile themselves to an ambiguous
and not very reasonable idiom—not very reasonable, that is, after
language has thrown off its early limitations, and got over the first
difficulty of accomplishing abstract expression of any kind. The sort
of fusion assumed is further illustrated for the Latinist, though not
so closely, by the Latin accusative and infinitive. This theory then
takes <i>violating</i> for a participle fused into one notion with
<i>friend</i>. There are two difficulties.</p>

<p>I. The construction in English is, though in the nature of things not
as common, yet as easy in the passive as in the active. Now the passive
of <i>violating</i> is either <i>violated</i> or <i>being violated</i>.
It is quite natural to say, Privacy violated once is no longer
inviolable. Why then should it be most unnatural to say, The worst of
privacy violated once is that it is no longer inviolable? No one, not
purposely seeking the unusual for some reason or other, would omit
<i>being</i> before <i>violated</i> in the second. Yet as participles
<i>violated</i> and <i>being violated</i> are equally good—not indeed
always, but in this context, as the simpler Privacy sentence shows. The
only difference between the two participles (except that in brevity,
which tells against <i>being violated</i>) is that the longer form
can also be the gerund, and the shorter cannot. The almost invariable
choice of it is due to the instinctive feeling that what we are using
is or ought to be the gerund. A more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> convincing instance than this
mere adaptation of our original example may be added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many years ago I became impressed with the necessity for <i>our
infantry being taught and practised</i> in the skilful use of their
rifle.—<span class="smcap">Lord Roberts.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>The necessity for our infantry taught and practised</i> is
absolutely impossible. But why, <i>if being</i> taught is participle,
and not gerund?</p>

<p>II. Assuming that the fused-participle theory is satisfactory and
recognized, whence comes the general, though not universal impression
among those who, without being well versed in grammar, are habitually
careful how they speak and write, that constructions like the following
are ignorant vulgarisms?—It is no use he (his) doing it; it is no use
him (his) doing it; that need not prevent us (our) believing; excuse
me (my) interrupting you; a thing (thing’s) existing does not prove
that it ought to exist; I was annoyed by Tom (Tom’s) hesitating; the
Tsar (Tsar’s) leaving Russia is significant; it failed through the King
(King’s) refusing his signature; without us (our) hearing the man, the
facts cannot be got at; without the man (man’s) telling us himself, we
can never know. With a single exception for one (not both) of the first
two, none of these ought to cause a moment’s uneasiness to any one who
was consciously or unconsciously in the fused-participle frame of mind;
and if they do cause uneasiness it shows that that frame of mind is not
effectively present.</p>

<p>The Fused-Participle Theory, having no sufficient answer to these
objections, but seeing that the gerund’s case is also weak, naturally
tries a counter-attack:—If on the other hand the gerund theory is
satisfactory and recognized, how is it conceivable that people should
leave out the possessive <i>’s</i> in the reckless way they do? To
which, however, the Gerund makes reply:—I regret that they do leave
it out, but at least we can see how they come to; it is the combined
result of a mistake and an inconvenience. The mistake is caused by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
certain types of sentence in which a real, not a fused participle is
so used that the noun and its (unfused) participle give a sense hardly
distinguishable from a possessive noun and a gerund. Examples are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This plan has now been abandoned owing to <i>circumstances
requiring</i> the convocation of representatives of the people at the
earliest possible moment.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>... by imposing as great difficulty as possible on <i>parents and
publicans using</i> child messengers.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Of course no obstacles should be put in the way of <i>charitable
people providing</i> free or other meals if they think
fit.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>The notion of <i>the Czar being addressed</i> in such terms by the
nobility of his capital would have been regarded as an absolute
impossibility.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There is of course a difference. For instance, in the example about
the Czar, as in a previous one about <i>conceiving Matthew Arnold
permitting</i>, the participle has a pictorial effect; it invites
us to imagine the physical appearance of these two great men under
indignity instead of merely thinking of the abstract indignity, as
we should have done if <i>Czar’s</i> and <i>Arnold’s</i> had shown
that we had a gerund; but the difference is very fine; the possessive
sign might be inserted without practical effect in all these four,
and in hundreds like them. And unlearned people may be excused for
deducing that the subject of the gerund can be used at pleasure without
the possessive sign, while the learned comfort themselves with the
fused-participle theory. That is the mistake. The inconvenience is
this: it is easy enough to use the possessive adjectives (<i>my</i>,
&amp;c.), and to add the possessive sign to most names and many single
nouns; but the subject of a gerund is often a long phrase, after which
the sign is intolerable. So the mistake (that the gerund may have a
subject not marked by the possessive) is eagerly applied to obviating
the inconvenience (that long gerund subjects must be avoided). And that
is why people drop their possessive <i>’s</i>, and why you, the Fused
Participle, flourish, defrauding both me, the Gerund,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> and the honest
participle. Thus answered, the Fused Participle does not continue the
argument, but pleads only that there is room for all three forms.</p>

<p>Before giving some examples to help in the decision, we shall summarize
our own opinion. (1) It is not a matter to be decided by appeal
to historical grammar. All three constructions may have separate
legitimate descents, and yet in the interests of clear thought and
expression it may be better for one of them to be abandoned. (2) There
are two opposite tendencies at present: among careful writers, to
avoid the fused participle (this, being negative, can naturally not
be illustrated) and to put possessive signs in slightly uncomfortable
places by way of compensation; among slovenly writers, to throw off
all limits of length for the subject of the fused participle. (3) Long
fused-participle phrases are a variety of abstract expression, and
as such to be deprecated. Among the resources of civilization is the
power of choosing between different ways of saying the same thing; and
literary skill is very much a matter of exercising that power; a writer
should recognize that if he cannot get round an ugly fused participle
there is still much for him to learn. (4) Opportunities for ambiguity
are so abundant in English, owing to the number of words whose parsing
depends on context, that all aids to precision are valuable; and it
is not too much to expect a writer to know and let us know whether he
means a participle or a gerund.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> That the possessive of all pronouns that have the form should
be used instead of the objective or subjective is hardly disputed.

<p><i>d.</i> A modern construction called the compound possessive was
mentioned at the end of the section on Cases. It is sometimes ugly,
sometimes inoffensive; that is a matter of degree and of knowing where
to draw the line; there is no objection to it in principle. And the
application of it will sometimes help out a gerund. The first quotation
gives a compound possessive simply; the second, a gerund construction
to which it ought to be applicable; the third and fourth, two to which
it can be applied; and the last, one to which it cannot.</p>

<p>The only objection to a possessive mark after <i>successor</i> is
that the two commas cannot be dispensed with; we must say <i>when
... took</i> for <i>on the occasion of ... taking</i>. <i>Such a
premier’s</i> will certainly pass. In the <i>Spectator</i> sentence,
we should ourselves allow <i>union’s</i>; opinions will differ. But
to put the <i>’s</i> after <i>poor</i> in the last sentence would
be ridiculous; that sentence must be rewritten—insisting that many

be admitted about most of our examples that the change is not to

The sentence is radically bad, because the essential construction seems
complete at <i>collision</i>—a false scent. That, which is one of the
worst literary sins, is the frequent result of long fused participles.
It is quite practically possible here for readers to have supposed that
they were going to be told why the fleets met, and not why the meeting
ended as it did. In the remaining sentences, we shall say when there is
false scent, but leave the reader to examine it.</p>

<p>After these specimens, chosen not as exceptional ones, but merely as

</div>

<p><b>2. When must the subject of the gerund (or infinitive) be expressed,
and when omitted?</b></p>

<p>This is not a controversial matter like the last; the principles are
quite simple, and will be accepted; but it is necessary to state and
illustrate them because they are often forgotten. As the same mistakes
are sometimes made with the infinitive, that is to be considered as
included.</p>

<p>Roughly, the subject of the gerund (or infinitive) should be expressed
if it is different from, and omitted if it is the same as, the subject
of the sentence. To omit it when different is positively wrong, and may
produce actual ambiguity or worse, though sometimes there is only a
slipshod effect; to insert it when the same is generally clumsy.</p>

<p>No one would say ‘I succeeded to his property upon dying’, because,
<i>I</i> being the subject of the sentence, <i>my</i> is naturally
suggested instead of the necessary <i>his</i> as subject of the gerund;
the <i>his</i> must be inserted before <i>dying</i>, even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> the
nature of the case obviates ambiguity. To take an instance that will
show both sides, the following is correct:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shut the door and stood with my back to it. Then, instead of <i>his
philandering</i> with Bess, I, Clementina MacTaggart, had some plain
speech with John Barnaby.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Subject of the sentence, I; subject of the gerund, he; they are
different; therefore the <i>he</i> must be expressed, in the shape of
<i>his</i>. Now rewrite the main sentence as—John Barnaby heard some
plain speech from me, Clementina MacTaggart. The sense is the same; but
the <i>his</i> before <i>philandering</i> at once becomes superfluous;
it is not yet seriously in the way, because we do not know what is the
subject of <i>philandering</i>, the name only coming later. Now rewrite
it again as—Then John Barnaby heard some plain speech from ... instead
of ... The <i>his</i> is now so clumsy as to be almost impossible.</p>

<p>The insertion of superfluous subjects is much less common than the
omission of necessary ones; but three examples follow. The first is a
rare and precious variety; the second has no apparent justification;
for the third it may be said that the unusual <i>his</i> has the same
effect as the insertion of the parenthetic words <i>as he actually
does</i> after <i>limiting</i> would have had.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You took food to him, but instead of <i>he reaching</i> out his hand
and taking it, he kept asking for food.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>Harsh facts: sure as she was of <i>her</i> never <i>losing</i> her
filial hold of the beloved.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>

<p>I have said that Mr. Chamberlain has no warrant for <i>his
limiting</i> the phrase ... to the competitive manufacture of
goods.—<span class="smcap">Lord Goschen.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In giving the rule summarily, we used the phrase <i>subject of the
sentence</i>. That phrase is not to be confined to the subject of the
main sentence, but to be referred instead, when necessary, to the
subject of the subordinate clause in which the gerund may stand. For
instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The good, the illuminated, sit apart from the rest, censuring their
dullness and vices, as if they thought that, <i>by sitting</i>
very grand in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> chairs, the very brokers, attorneys, and
congressmen would see the error of their ways, and flock to
them.—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Here <i>by sitting</i> breaks the rule, though the subject of
<i>sitting</i> is the same as that of the main verb <i>sit</i>, because
the subject of the clause in which <i>sitting</i> comes is not <i>the
good</i>, but <i>brokers, &amp;c.</i> The right way to mend this is not to
insert <i>their</i> before <i>sitting</i>—which after all is clumsy,
though correct—but to make <i>the good</i> the subject of the clause
also, by writing <i>as if they thought that by sitting ... they would
make the brokers ... see the error</i>.</p>

<p>And sometimes <i>subject of the sentence</i> is to be interpreted still
more freely as the word grammatically dominant in the part of the
sentence that contains the gerund. For instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the Bible alone was she taught the duties of morality, but
familiarized to her taste <i>by hearing</i> its stories and precepts
from the lips she best loved.—<span class="smcap">S. Ferrier.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Here the dominant word is <i>Bible</i>, to which <i>familiarized</i>
belongs. So, though <i>she</i> does happen to be the main subject,
<i>her</i> must be inserted because the <i>familiarized</i> phrase
removes the gerund from the reach of the main subject.</p>

<p>After these explanations we add miscellaneous instances. It will be
seen that transgression of the rule, though it seldom makes a sentence
ambiguous enough to deceive, easily makes it ambiguous enough to amuse
the reader at wrong moments, or gives an impression of amateurish work.
Mistakes are mended, sometimes by inserting the subject of the gerund
(or infinitive), sometimes by changing the main subject to make it the
same as that of the gerund, sometimes by other recasting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... an excellent arrangement for a breeching, which, when

</div>

<p>Write <i>if I assumed</i>; or else <i>I should induce certain ...
persons to talk</i>. It will be noticed that the mistake here, and
often, is analogous to the most frequent form of wrongly attached
participle (participle, 5); the writer does not observe that he has
practically passed from the sphere of the sentence whose subject was
the word that he still allows to operate.</p>

<p>It will have occurred to the reader that, while most of the sentences
quoted are to be condemned, objection to a few of them might be called
pedantic. The fact is that every writer probably breaks the rule
often, and escapes notice, other people’s, his own, or both. Different
readers, however, will be critical in different degrees; and whoever
breaks the rule does so at his own risk; if his offence is noticed,
that is hanging evidence against him by itself; if it is not noticed,
it is not an offence. Of saying on page 127 <i>Mistakes are mended

<p><b>3. Choice between the gerund with preposition and the infinitive.</b></p>

<p>It was said in the preliminary section on the Participle and
Gerund that <i>writing</i>—the verbal noun or gerund—and <i>to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
write</i>—the infinitive—are in some sense synonyms; but phrases
were given showing that it is by no means always indifferent which of
the two is used. It is a matter of idiom rather than of grammar; but
this seems the most convenient place for drawing attention to it. To
give satisfactory rules would require many more examples and much more
space than can be afforded. But something will be gained if students
are convinced (1) that many of the mistakes made give sentences the
appearance of having been written by a foreigner or one who is not
at home with the literary language; (2) that the mistakes are nearly
always on one side, the infinitive being the form that should only be
used with caution; (3) that a slight change in arrangement may require
a change from infinitive to gerund or vice versa.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> When the infinitive or gerund is attached to a noun, defining
or answering the question <i>what</i> (hope, &amp;c.) about it, it is
almost always better to use the gerund with of; not quite always,
however; for instance, <i>an intention to return</i>, usually, and <i>a
tendency to think</i> always.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shall and Will</span></h3>

<p>It is unfortunate that the idiomatic use, while it comes by nature to
southern Englishmen (who will find most of this section superfluous),
is so complicated that those who are not to the manner born can hardly
acquire it; and for them the section is in danger of being useless. In
apology for the length of these remarks it must be said that the short
and simple directions often given are worse than useless. The observant
reader soon loses faith in them from their constant failure to take him
right; and the unobservant is the victim of false security.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, <i>should</i> follows the same rules as
<i>shall</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span> and <i>would</i> as <i>will</i>; in what follows, Sh.
may be taken as an abbreviation for <i>shall</i>, <i>should</i>, and
<i>should have</i>, and W. for <i>will</i>, <i>would</i>, and <i>would
have</i>.</p>

<p>In our usage of the Sh. and W. forms, as seen in principal sentences,
there are elements belonging to three systems. The first of these,
in which each form retains its full original meaning, and the two
are not used to give different persons of the same tense, we shall
call the pure system: the other two, both hybrids, will be called,
one the coloured-future, the other the plain-future system. In Old
English there was no separate future; present and future were one.
<i>Shall</i> and <i>will</i> were the presents of two verbs, to which
belong also the pasts <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, the conditionals
<i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, and the past conditionals <i>should
have</i> and <i>would have</i>. <i>Shall</i> had the meaning of command
or obligation, and <i>will</i> of wish. But as commands and wishes are
concerned mainly with the future, it was natural that a future tense
auxiliary should be developed out of these two verbs. The coloured
future results from the application to future time of those forms that
were practically useful in the pure system; they consequently retain
in the coloured future, with some modifications, the ideas of command
and wish proper to the original verbs. The plain future results from
the taking of those forms that were practically out of work in the pure
system to make what had not before existed, a simple future tense;
these have accordingly not retained the ideas of command and wish.
Which were the practically useful and which the superfluous forms in
the pure system must now be explained.</p>

<p><i>Thou shall not steal</i> is the type of <i>shall</i> in the pure
system. We do not ordinarily issue commands to ourselves; consequently
<i>I shall</i> is hardly required; but we often ask for orders, and
therefore <i>shall I?</i> is required. The form of the <i>shall</i>
present in the pure system is accordingly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shall I? You shall. He shall. Shall we? They shall.</p>
</div>

<p>As to the past tense, orders cannot be given, but may be asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> about,
so that, for instance, <i>What should I do?</i> (i. e., What was I to
do?) can be done all through interrogatively.</p>

<p>In the conditionals, both statement and question can be done all
through. I can give orders to my imaginary, though not to my actual
self. I cannot say (as a command) <i>I shall do it</i>; but I can say,
as a conditional command, <i>I should do it</i>.</p>

<p><i>I shall</i> and <i>we shall</i> are accordingly the superfluous
forms of the present <i>shall</i> in the pure system.</p>

<p>Again, with <i>will</i>, <i>I will</i> meaning <i>it is my will</i>, it
is obvious that we can generally state this only of ourselves; we do
not know the inside of other people’s minds, but we can ask about it.
The present runs, then,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will. Will you? Will he? We will. Will they?</p>
</div>

<p>The past tense can here be done all through, both positively and
interrogatively. For though we cannot tell other people’s present will,
we can often infer their past will from their actions. So (I was asked,
but) <i>I would not</i>, and <i>Why would I do it?</i> all through. And
similarly in the conditionals, <i>I would not</i> (if I could), &amp;c.</p>

<p>The spare forms supplied by the present <i>will</i>, then, are <i>you
will</i>, <i>he will</i>, <i>they will</i>; and these, with <i>I
shall</i>, <i>we shall</i>, are ready, when the simple future is
required, to construct it out of. We can now give</p>


<p>Rule 1. The Pure System</p>

<p>When Sh. and W. retain the full original meanings of command and wish,
each of them is used in all three persons, so far as it is required.</p>

<p>The following examples show most of what we inherit directly from the
pure system.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thou shalt not steal. Not required in first person.</p>

<p>Shall I open the door? Not required in second.</p>

<p>You should not say such things. In all persons.</p>

<p>And shall Trelawny die? Hardly required in second.</p>

<p>Whom should he meet but Jones? (... was it his fate....) In all.</p>

<p>Why should you suspect me? In all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>It should seem so. (It would apparently be incumbent on us to believe)
Isolated idiom with third.</p>

<p>I will have my way. Not required in second and third; but see below.</p>

<p>I (he) asked him (me) to do it, but he (I) would not. In all.</p>

<p>I would not have done it for the world. In all.</p>

<p>I would be told to wait a while (Habitual). In all.</p>

<p>Will you come with me? Not required in first.</p>

<p>I would I were dead. Not required in second and third.</p>

<p>He will bite his nails, whatever I say. In all.</p>

<p>He will often stand on his head. In all.</p>

<p>You will still be talking (i. e., you always are). Not required in
first.</p>

<p>A coat will last two years with care.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the last four forms are among those that were
omitted as not required by the pure system. <i>Will</i> would rarely
be required in second and third person statements, but would of course
be possible in favourable circumstances, as in describing habitual
action, where the will of another may be inferred from past experience.
The last of all is a natural extension of the idiom even to things
that have no will. All these ‘habitual’ uses are quite different from
<i>I will have my way</i>; and though <i>you will have your way</i> is
possible, it always has the ‘habitual’ meaning, which <i>I will have my
way</i> is usually without.</p>

<p>All the forms in the above list, and others like them, have three
peculiarities—that they are not practically futures as distinguished
from presents; that they use Sh. for all persons, or W. for all
persons, if the idea is appropriate to all persons; and that the
ideas are simply, or with very little extension, those of command or
obligation and wish.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The coloured-future system is so called because, while the future sense
is more distinct, it is still coloured with the speaker’s mood; command
and wish receive extensions and include promise, permission, menace,
consent, assurance, intention, refusal, offer, &amp;c.; and the forms
used are invariably those—from both Sh. and W.—that we called the
practically useful ones in the pure system. That is, we have always</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will, shall I? You shall, will you? He shall, will he? We will,
shall we? They shall, will they?</p>
</div>

<p>And the conditionals, <i>should</i> and <i>would</i>, <i>should
have</i> and <i>would have</i>, are used with exactly the same
variations. It will be borne in mind, however, that no clear line of
division can be drawn between the pure system and the coloured-future
system, since the latter is developed naturally (whereas the
plain-future system is rather developed artificially) out of the
former. And especially the questions of the coloured future are simply
those of the pure system without any sort of modification.</p>


<p>Rule 2. The Coloured-Future System</p>

<p>In future and conditional statements that include (without the use of
special words for the purpose) an expression of the speaker’s (not
necessarily of the subject’s) wish, intention, menace, assurance,
consent, refusal, promise, offer, permission, command, &amp;c.—in such
sentences the first person has W., the second and third persons Sh.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I will tell you presently. My promise.</p>

<p>You shall repent it before long. My menace.</p>

<p>He shall not have any. My refusal.</p>

<p>We would go if we could. Our conditional intention.</p>

<p>You should do it if we could make you. Our conditional command.</p>

<p>They should have had it if they had asked. My conditional consent.</p>
</div>

<p>The only questions possible here are the asking for orders and the
requests already disposed of under Rule 1.</p>

<p>Observe that <i>I would like</i> (which is not English) is not
justified by this rule, because the speaker’s mood is expressed by
<i>like</i>, and does not need double expression; it ought to be <i>I
should like</i>, under Rule 3.</p>

<p>Observe also that <i>I sha’n’t</i>, <i>You will go to your room and
stay there</i>, are only apparent exceptions, which will be explained
under Rule 3.</p>

<p>The archaic literary forms <i>You shall find</i>, <i>A rogue shall
often pass for an honest man</i>, though now affected and pretentious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
are grammatically defensible. The speaker asks us to take the fact on
his personal assurance.</p>

<p>The forms little required in the pure system, and therefore ready to
hand for making the new plain future, were <i>I</i>, and <i>we</i>,
<i>shall</i>; <i>you</i>, <i>he</i>, and <i>they</i>, <i>will</i>.
These accordingly constitute the plain future, and the corresponding
forms of the plain conditional are used analogously. Questions follow
the same rule, with one very important exception, which will be given a
separate rule (4). We now give</p>


<p>Rule 3. The Plain-Future System</p>

<p>In plain statements about the future, and in the principal clause,
result, or apodosis, of plain conditional sentences (whether the
subordinate clause, condition, or <i>if</i>-clause, is expressed
or not), the first person has Sh., the second and third persons W.
Questions conform, except those of the second person, for which see
Rule 4.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Should I, would he, like it myself, himself?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some apparent exceptions, already anticipated, must here be explained.
It may be said that <i>I shall execute your orders</i> being the
speaker’s promise, <i>You will go to your room</i> being the speaker’s
command, and <i>Sha’n’t</i> (the nursery abbreviation for <i>I shall
not do it</i>) being the speaker’s refusal, these are all coloured
futures, so that Sh. and W. should be reversed in each. They are such
in effect, but they are not in form. In each, the other form would be
possible and correct. The first is a promise only so far as the hearer
chooses to take as a promise the plain future or impersonal prophecy;
but the speaker emphasizes his obedience by implying that of course,
since the order has been given, it will be executed; the matter is
settled without his unimportant consent. The other two gain force by
the opposite assumption that the speaker’s will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> and the future are
absolutely identical, so that what he intends may be confidently stated
as a future fact. In the first example the desired submissiveness, in
the other two the desired imperiousness, supercilious or passionate,
are attained by the same impersonality.</p>

<p>Before giving the rule for second-person questions, we observe that
questions generally follow the rule of the class of statement they
correspond to. This was shown in the pure system (Rule 1). There are
no questions (apart from those already accounted for by the pure
system) belonging to the coloured future (Rule 2). In the plain future
(Rule 3), first and third person questions are like the plain-future
statements. But second-person questions under the plain future
invariably use Sh. or W. according as the answer for which the speaker
is prepared has Sh. or W. Care is necessary, however, in deciding
what that answer is. In <i>Should (would) you like a bathe?</i>
<i>should</i> is almost always right, because the answer expected is
almost always either <i>Yes, I should</i>, or <i>No, I should not</i>,
the question being asked for real information. It is true that <i>Would
you like?</i> is very commonly used, like the equally wrong <i>I would
like</i>; but it is only correct when the answer is intended to be
given by the asker:—<i>No, of course you would not.</i> A clearer
illustration of this is the following sentence, which requires Sh. or
W. according to circumstances: <i>Will (shall) you, now so fresh and
fair, be in a hundred years nothing but mouldering dust?</i>. This
might possibly be asked in expectation of an answer from the person
apostrophized—<i>Yes, I shall.</i> Much more probably it would be
asked in expectation of the answer from the speaker himself to his own
question—<i>Alas! yes, you will.</i> And <i>shall</i> ought to be used
for the question only in the first case, <i>will</i> in the second
case. Similarly, <i>Ah, yes, that is all very well; but will (shall)
you be able to do it?</i> Use <i>will</i> if the answer is meant to be
<i>No, of course you will not</i>; <i>shall</i>, if the answer expected
is <i>Yes, I shall</i>, or <i>No, I shall not</i>.</p>

<p>In practice, Sh. is more commonly required, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> questions asked
for information are commoner than rhetorical ones. But observe the
common <i>Would you believe it?</i>, Answer, <i>No, of course you
would not.</i> <i>Should you believe it?</i>, also possible, would
indicate real curiosity about the other person’s state of mind, which
is hardly ever felt. <i>Would you believe it?</i>, however, might also
be accounted for on the ground that the answer would be <i>No, I would
not</i>, which would be a coloured-future form, meaning <i>I should
never consent to believe</i>.</p>


<p>Rule 4. Second-person Questions</p>

<p>Second-person questions invariably have Sh. or W. by assimilation to
the answer expected.</p>

<p>It may be added, since it makes the application of the rule easier,
that the second-person questions belonging not to the plain future
but to the pure system are also, though not because of assimilation,
the same in regard to Sh. and W. as their answers. Thus <i>Will you
come?</i> <i>Yes, I will</i> (each on its merits), as well as <i>Shall
you be there?</i> <i>Yes, I shall</i> (assimilation). <i>Should you not
have known?</i> <i>Yes, I should</i> (each on its merits; <i>should</i>
means <i>ought</i>), as well as <i>What should you think?</i> <i>I
should think you were right</i> (assimilation). The true form for all
second-person questions, then, can be ascertained by deciding what the
expected answer is.</p>

<p>This completes what need be said about principal sentences, with the
exception of one important usage that might cause perplexity. If
some one says to me ‘You would think so yourself if you were in my
position’, I may either answer ‘No, I should not’ regularly, or may
catch up his word, and retain the W., though the alteration of person
requires Sh. Thus—‘Would I, though? No, I wouldn’t’. Accordingly,</p>


<p>Rule 5. Echoes</p>

<p>A speaker repeating and adapting another’s words may neglect to make
the alteration from Sh. to W., or from W. to Sh., that an alteration of
the person strictly requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>We have now all the necessary rules for principal sentences, and can
put down a few examples of the right usage, noteworthy for various
reasons, and some blunders, the latter being illustrated in proportion
to their commonness. The number of the rule observed or broken will be
added in brackets for reference. The passage from Johnson with which
the correct examples begin is instructive.</p>

<p>We give first many examples of the mistake that is out of all
proportion the commonest—using the coloured future when the speaker’s
mood is sufficiently given by a separate word. In the second example,
for instance, <i>I would ask the favour</i> would be quite right,
and would mean <i>I should like to ask</i>. As it stands, it means
<i>I should like to like to ask</i>. The same applies to the other
instances, which are only multiplied to show how dangerous this
particular form is.</p>

<p><b>We now proceed to Subordinate Clauses, and first to the
Substantival.</b> The word ‘reported’ will mean ‘made indirect’ or
‘subordinated substantivally’, not always actually reported.</p>

<p><b>Reported statement</b> is quite simple when it is of the pure
system or the coloured future; the Sh. or W. of the original statement
is retained in the reported form, unaffected by any change of person
that the reporting involves. Thus: (Pure system) <i>He forgave me</i>
(<i>you</i>, or <i>her</i>), <i>though he said I</i> (<i>you</i>, or
<i>she</i>) <i>should not have left him in the lurch like that.</i>
(Coloured future) <i>You said I</i> (or <i>he</i>) <i>should repent
it</i>; either of these is a report of either <i>You shall repent
it</i> or <i>He shall repent it</i>. (Coloured future) <i>You said
you</i> (or <i>I said I</i>) <i>would apologize</i>; both are reports
of <i>I will apologize</i>.</p>

<p>But with the plain-future system there is difficulty and some
inconsistency. The change of person sometimes required by reported
speech has almost always the effect here of introducing Sh. if <i>I</i>
or <i>we</i> appears in the words as reported, and usually the effect
of introducing W. if <i>you</i>, <i>he</i>, or <i>they</i>, appears.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> following are all the types in which doubt can arise, except that
each of these may occur in either number, and in past or present. The
form that would be required by analogy (keeping the original Sh. or
W.) is given first, and the one generally used instead is added in
brackets. Reporting <i>I shall never succeed</i>, we get</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You said you should (would) never succeed.</p>

<p>He says he shall (will) never succeed.</p>
</div>

<p>Reporting <i>you will</i> (or <i>he will</i>) <i>never succeed</i>, we
get</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You say I will (shall) never succeed.</p>

<p>He said I would (should) never succeed.</p>
</div>

<p>Even those persons who have generally a just confidence in their own
correctness about Sh. and W. will allow that they have some doubt about
the first pair; and nearly every one will find W. in the second pair,
however reasonable and consistent, intolerable.</p>

<p>If the reader will now go through the four sentences again, and
substitute for <i>succeed</i> the phrase <i>do it</i> (which may or may
not mean <i>succeed</i>), he will see that the orthodox <i>should</i>
and <i>shall</i> of the first pair become actually more natural than
the commoner <i>would</i> and <i>will</i>; and that even in the second
pair <i>will</i> and <i>would</i> are now tolerable. The reason is that
with <i>do it</i> there is risk of confusion with the reported forms
of <i>I will never do it</i> and <i>you shall never do it</i>, which
are not plain futures, but coloured futures meaning something quite
different.</p>

<p><b>Reported questions</b> present the same difficulties. Again those
only are doubtful that belong to the plain future. There, for instance,
reporting <i>Shall you do it?</i> we can say by the correct analogy
<i>I asked him whether he should</i>; and we generally do so if the
verb, as here, lends itself to ambiguity: <i>I asked him whether he
would do it</i> is liable to be mistaken for the report of <i>Will you
do it?</i>—a request. If on the other hand (as in reporting <i>Shall
you be there?</i>) there is little risk of misunderstanding, <i>I asked
him whether he would</i> is commoner. And again it is only in extreme
cases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> if even then, that the original W. can be kept when the report
introduces <i>I</i> in place of the original question’s <i>you</i> or
<i>he</i>. For instance, the original question being <i>How will he be
treated?</i>, it may be just possible to say <i>You had made up your
mind how I would be treated</i>, because <i>You had made up your mind
how I should be treated</i> almost inevitably suggests (assisted by
the ambiguity of <i>making up your mind</i>, which may imply either
resolve or inference) that the original question was <i>How shall he be
treated?</i></p>

<p>It would be well, perhaps, if writers who take their responsibilities
seriously would stretch a point sometimes to keep the more consistent
and less ambiguous usage alive; but for practical purposes the rule
must run:</p>


<p>Rule 6. Substantival Clauses.</p>

<p>In these (whether ‘reported’ strictly or otherwise subordinated)
pure-system or coloured-future forms invariably keep the Sh. or W. of
the original statement or question, unaffected by any change of person.
Reports of plain-future forms do this also, if there would be serious
danger of ambiguity, but almost always have Sh. in the first person,
and usually W. in the second and third persons.</p>

<p>As the division of substantival clauses into indirect (or reported or
subordinate or oblique) statements, questions, <i>and commands</i>,
is familiar, it may be well to explain that in English the reported
command strictly so called hardly exists. In what has the force of
a reported command it is in fact a statement that is reported. For
instance, <i>He said I was to go</i>, though used as the indirect form
of <i>Go</i>, is really the indirect of the statement <i>You are to
go</i>. <i>He ordered that they should be released</i> (though the
actual words were <i>Be they</i>, or <i>Let them be, released</i>) is
formed on the coloured-future statement, <i>They shall be released</i>.
It is therefore unnecessary to give special rules for reported command.
But there are one or two types of apparent indirect command about
which, though there is no danger of error, the reader may feel curious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>a. <i>I stipulate that I shall, you shall, he shall, do it.</i> Why
<i>shall</i> in all persons? because the original form is: <i>I</i>
(<i>you</i>, <i>he</i>) <i>shall do it</i>, <i>I stipulate that</i>,
where <i>shall</i> means <i>am to</i>, <i>are to</i>, <i>is to</i>;
that is, it is a pure-system form.</p>

<p>b. <i>I beg that you</i> (or <i>he</i>) <i>will do it.</i> <i>He begs
that I will do it.</i> Again the original is pure-system: <i>You</i>
(or <i>he</i>) <i>will</i> (i. e., you consent to) <i>do it: that is
what I beg.</i> <i>I will</i> (i. e., I consent to) <i>do it: that is
what he begs.</i></p>

<p>c. <i>I beg that I</i> (or <i>he</i>) <i>shall not suffer for it.</i>
<i>You begged that I should not suffer for it.</i> Observe that b. has
<i>will</i> and a. and c. <i>shall</i>, because it is only in b. that
the volition of the subject of <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> is concerned.</p>

<p>d. <i>I wish you would not sneeze.</i> Before subordination this
is: <i>You will not sneeze: that is what I wish.</i> W. remains,
but <i>will</i> becomes <i>would</i> to give the remoteness always
connected with wish, which is seen also, for instance, in <i>I wish I
were</i> instead of <i>I wish I be</i>.</p>

<p>Before going on to examples of substantival clauses, we also register,
again rather for the curious than for the practical reader, the
peculiar but common use of <i>should</i> contained in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not strange that his admiration for those writers should have
been unbounded.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In this use <i>should</i> goes through all persons and is equivalent
to a gerund with possessive: <i>that a man should be</i> is the same
as <i>a man’s being</i>. We can only guess at its origin; our guess
is that (1) <i>should</i> is the remote form for <i>shall</i>, as
<i>would</i> for <i>will</i> in d. above, substituted in order to give
an effect of generality; and (2) the use of <i>shall</i> is the archaic
one seen in <i>You shall find</i>, &amp;c. So: a man shall be afraid of his
shadow; that a man should be afraid (as a generally observed fact) is
strange.</p>

<p>After each of the substantival clauses, of which examples now follow,
we shall say whether it is a reported (subordinated) statement, or
question, and give what we take to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> the original form of the
essential words, even when further comment is unnecessary.</p>

the writers would have made the mistake in the original unsubordinated

our experience is, however, that many people do in fact go wrong in
subordinate clauses who are alive to the danger in simple sentences.</p>

</div>

<p>Statement. They shall be incorporated. We have classed this as wrong on
the assumption, supported by the word <i>assurance</i>, that the Prime
Minister gave a promise, and therefore used the coloured future, and
did not state a fact and use the plain future.</p>

<p>Another type of subordinate clause important for Sh. and W. is <b>the
conditional protasis or if-clause</b>. It is not necessary, nor with
modern writers usual, to mark the future or conditional force of
this separately, since it is sufficiently indicated by the apodosis.
For instance, <i>If you come I shall be glad</i>; <i>if you came I
should be glad</i>; <i>if you had come I should have been glad</i>.
But in formal style or with a slight difference of meaning, it is
often superfluously done in the protasis too. Sh. is then used for
all persons, as, <i>If he should come, you would learn how the matter
stands</i>. So:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Japan will adhere to her pledge of neutrality unless Russia shall
first violate hers.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>But to the rule that the protasis takes <i>shall</i> there are
three exceptions, real or apparent; W. is found under the following
circumstances:</p>

<p>(1.) An original pure-system or coloured-future W. is not changed to
Sh. by being used in subordination to <i>if</i> (or <i>unless</i>).
It is retained with its full original force instead of some verb like
<i>wish</i> or <i>choose</i>. In <i>If we would believe we might move
mountains</i>, the meaning is <i>If we chose to believe</i>, different
from that of <i>If we believed</i> or <i>should believe</i>. So</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It would be much better if you would not be so hypocritical, Captain
Wybrow.—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It would be valuable if he would somewhat expand his ideas regarding
local defence by Volunteers.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If he consented to.</p>

<p>(2.) When the <i>if</i>-clause (though a genuine condition) is
incorrectly expressed for the sake of brevity and compresses two verbs
into one, the W. proper to the retained verb is sometimes necessarily
used instead of the Sh. proper to the verb that, though it contains
in strict logic the essential protasis, has been crushed out. Thus:
<i>If it will be useless I shall prefer not to do it.</i> It is not
the uselessness that is the condition of the preference; for the use
or uselessness is subsequent to the decision; it is my conviction of
the uselessness; so that the full form would be <i>If I shall be</i>
(or <i>am</i> in ordinary speech) <i>convinced that it will be useless,
I shall prefer</i>, &amp;c. The following example can be defended on this
ground, <i>if never again will he</i> standing for <i>if he shall
realize that he will never</i>; the feebleness that decides his not
wishing is subsequent to it, and can only condition it if taken in the
sense of his anticipation of feebleness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And if there is to be no recovery, <i>if never again will he</i> be
young and strong and passionate, if the actual present shall be to him
always like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the far-away
past; he will not greatly wish for the continuance of a twilight
that....—<span class="smcap">Stevenson.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>The next is more difficult only because, besides the compression, the
<i>if</i>-clause is protasis not to the expressed main sentence, but to
another that is suppressed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall wait for fine weather, if that will ever come.—<span class="smcap">R. G.
White.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Given fully, this would run: I shall wait for fine weather; (at least I
should say so) if (I were sure that) that will ever come.</p>

<p>(3.) When an <i>if</i>-clause is not a condition at all, as for
instance where it expresses contrast, and is almost equivalent to
<i>although</i>, the ordinary plain-future use prevails. Thus: <i>If
annihilation will end our joys it will also end our griefs.</i>
Contrast with this the real condition, in: <i>If annihilation shall
end</i> (or <i>ends</i>) <i>our joys, we shall never regret the loss of
them.</i></p>

<p><b>Indefinite clauses, relative or other</b>, bearing the same
relation to a conditional or future principal sentence that a
conditional protasis bears to its apodosis follow the same rules. Thus
<i>Whoever compares the two will find</i> is equivalent to <i>If any
one compares</i>; <i>When we have won the battle we can decide that
question</i> is equivalent to <i>If ever we have won</i>. Accordingly
we can if we choose write <i>Whoever shall compare</i>, and <i>When we
shall have won</i>; but we cannot write <i>When we will have won</i>,
and must only write <i>Whoever will compare</i> if we distinctly mean
<i>Whoever chooses to compare</i>. As there is sometimes difficulty in
analysing indefinite clauses of this sort, one or two instances had
better be considered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

at length it will become possible to conclude the peace so ardently

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>This is a complicated example. The <i>shalls</i> will be right if it
appears that each <i>shall</i>-clause is equivalent to a conditional
protasis. We may show it by starting at the end as with the house that
Jack built and constructing the sentence backwards, subordinating by
stages, and changing <i>will</i> to <i>shall</i> as the protases come
in; it will be allowed that <i>until</i> means <i>to the time when</i>,
and that <i>when</i> may be resolved into <i>if ever</i>. Thus we
get: <i>a.</i> One will know. <i>b.</i> None will be a member of the
legislature unless one shall know. <i>c.</i> It will distil to the time
if ever none shall be a member unless one shall know.</p>

<p>Although <i>think what I will</i> is an indefinite relative clause,
meaning practically <i>whatever I think</i>, <i>will</i> here is right,
the strict sense being <i>whatever I choose to think</i>. Indeed the
time of <i>think</i> is probably not, at any rate need not be, future
at all; compare <i>Think what I will, I do not tell my thoughts.</i></p>

<p>We now give</p>

<p><b>Rule 7. Conditional protasis and Indefinite Clauses</b></p>

<p>In the protasis or <i>if</i>-clause of conditional sentences Sh. may
be used with all persons. Generally neither Sh. nor W. is used. W. is
only used (1) when the full meaning of <i>wish</i> is intended; it may
then be used with all persons; (2) when the protasis is elliptically
expressed; W. may then be necessary with the second and third persons;
(3) when the <i>if</i>-clause is not a real conditional protasis; there
is then no reason for Sh. with second and third persons. Indefinite
classes of similar character follow the same rules.</p>

<p>It should never be, but often is, forgotten that when the apodosis

<p>It may be worth while to add that the subordinate apodosis still
follows the rule even if it is subordinated to <i>if</i>, so that it is
part of the protasis of another conditional sentence. The following,
which is of course quite correct, seems, but only seems, to break the
rules both for protasis and apodosis: If you would be patient for
yourself, you should be patient for me. But we have W. with second
person in the protasis because <i>would be patient</i> is also apodosis
to the implied protasis <i>if occasion should arise</i>; and the
<i>should</i> with second person in the apodosis is not a conditional
<i>should</i> at all, but a pure-system <i>should</i>, which would be
the same with any person; it means simply <i>you ought</i>, or <i>it

<h3><span class="smcap">The Perfect Infinitive</span></h3>

<p>This has its right and its wrong uses. The right are obvious, and can
be left alone. Even of the wrong some are serviceable, if not strictly
logical. <i>I hoped to have succeeded</i>, for instance, means <i>I
hoped to succeed, but I did not succeed</i>, and has the advantage of
it in brevity; it is an idiom that it would be a pity to sacrifice on
the altar of Reason. So:</p>

<p>The use of true subjunctive forms (if he be, though it happen) in
conditional sentences is for various reasons not recommended. These
forms, with the single exception of <i>were</i>, are perishing so
rapidly that an experienced word-actuary<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> puts their expectation
of life at one generation. As a matter of style, they should be
avoided, being certain to give a pretentious air when handled by any
one except the skilful and practised writers who need no advice from
us. And as a matter of grammar, the instinct for using subjunctives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
rightly is dying with the subjunctive, so that even the still surviving
<i>were</i> is often used where it is completely wrong. So</p>

</div>

<p>Here the last clause means <i>though perhaps it was only planned
with an eye to effect</i> (<i>and therefore has no military
significance</i>). But <i>if</i> followed by <i>were not</i>
necessarily means that it certainly is. The mistake here results in
making the clause look as if it were the protasis to <i>It would be
advisable</i>, with which it has in fact nothing whatever to do; it is
a note on the words <i>military significance</i>. Write <i>was</i> for

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">‘Doubt that’ and ‘doubt whether’</span></h3>

<p>Instances will be found in Part II of verbs constructed with wrong
prepositions or conjunctions. Most mistakes of this kind are
self-evident; but the verb ‘doubt’, which is constructed with ‘that’
or ‘whether’ according to the circumstances under which the doubt is
expressed, requires special notice. The broad distinction is between
the positive, ‘I doubt whether (that)’ and the negative, ‘I do not
doubt that (whether)’;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> and the rule, in order to include implied as
well as expressed negatives, questions as well as statements, will run
thus:</p>

<p>The word used depends upon the writer’s or speaker’s opinion as to the
reasonableness of the doubt, no matter in whose mind it is said to
exist or not to exist.</p>

<p>1. If there is nothing to show that the writer considers the doubt an
unreasonable one, the word is always ‘whether’, which reminds us that
there is a suppressed alternative:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I doubt whether this is true (or not).</p>

<p>Every one is at liberty to doubt whether ... (or not).</p>
</div>

<p>To this part of the rule there is no exception.</p>

<p>2. If it is evident that the writer disapproves of the doubt, the words
introducing it amount to an affirmation on his part that the thing
doubted is undoubtedly true; the alternative is no longer offered;
‘that’ is therefore the word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not doubt that (i. e., I am sure that)....</p>

<p>Who can doubt that...?</p>
</div>

<p>This, however, is modified by 3.</p>

<p>3. The ‘vivid’ use of ‘whether’. When the writer’s point is rather
the extravagance of the doubt than the truth of the thing doubted,
‘whether’ is often retained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is as if a man should doubt whether he has a head on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Can we imagine any man seriously doubting whether...?</p>
</div>

<p>Here, according to 2., we ought to have ‘that’, since the writer
evidently regards the doubt as absurd. But in the first sentence it
is necessary for the force of the illustration that the deplorable
condition of the doubter’s mind should be vividly portrayed:
accordingly, he is represented to us as actually handling the two
alternatives. Similarly, in the second, we are invited to picture
to ourselves, if we can, a hesitation so ludicrous in the writer’s
opinion. We shall illustrate this point further by a couple of
sentences in which again the state of mind of the doubter, not the
truth of the thing doubted, is clearly the point, but in which ‘that’
has been improperly substituted for the vivid ‘whether’:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She found herself wondering at the breath she drew, doubting that
another would follow.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>

<p>I am afraid that you will become so afraid of men’s motives as to
doubt that any one can be honest.—<span class="smcap">Trollope.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The mistake commonly made is to use ‘that’ for ‘whether’ in violation
of 1. ‘Whether’ is seldom used in place of ‘that’, and apparent
violations of 2. often prove to be legitimate exceptions of the ‘vivid’
kind. Some of our examples may suggest that when the dependent clause
is placed before the verb, ‘that’ appears because the writer had not
decided what verb of doubt or denial to use. This is probably the true
explanation of many incorrect <i>thats</i>, but is not a sufficient
defence. It supplies, on the contrary, an additional reason for
adhering to ‘whether’: the reader is either actually misled or at any
rate kept in needless suspense as to what is going to be said, because
the writer did not make up his mind at the right time how to say it.
‘Whether’ at the beginning at once proclaims an open question: after
‘that’ we expect (or ought to expect) ‘I have <i>no</i> reason to
doubt’.</p>

<p>In all the following, ‘whether’ should have been used.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prepositions</span></h3>

<p>In an uninflected language like ours these are ubiquitous, and it is
quite impossible to write tolerably without a full knowledge, conscious
or unconscious, of their uses. Misuse of them, however, does not
often result in what may be called in the fullest sense blunders of
syntax, but mostly in offences against idiom. It is often impossible
to convince a writer that the preposition he has used is a wrong one,
because there is no reason in the nature of things, in logic, or in
the principles of universal grammar (whichever way it may be put), why
that preposition should not give the desired meaning as clearly as the
one that we tell him he should have used. Idioms are special forms of
speech that for some reason, often inscrutable, have proved congenial
to the instinct of a particular language. To neglect them shows a
writer, however good a logician he may be, to be no linguist—condemns
him, from that point of view, more clearly than grammatical blunders
themselves. But though the subject of prepositions is thus very
important, the idioms in which they appear are so multitudinous that it
is hopeless to attempt giving more than the scantiest selection; this
may at least put writers on their guard. Usages of this sort cannot be
acquired from dictionaries and grammars, still less from a treatise
like the present, not pretending to be exhaustive; good reading with
the idiomatic eye open is essential. We give a few examples of what to
avoid.</p>

<p>Insensible to, but unconscious of; indifferent to, but oblivious of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>The adjectives <i>different</i> and <i>averse</i>, with their adverbs
or nouns, <i>differently</i>, <i>difference</i>, <i>aversion</i>,
<i>averseness</i>, call for a few words of comment. There is no
essential reason whatever why either set should not be as well followed
by <i>to</i> as by <i>from</i>. But <i>different to</i> is regarded
by many newspaper editors and others in authority as a solecism, and
is therefore better avoided by those to whom the approval of such
authorities is important. It is undoubtedly gaining ground, and will
probably displace <i>different from</i> in no long time; perhaps,
however, the conservatism that still prefers <i>from</i> is not yet
to be named pedantry. It is at any rate defensive, and not offensive
pedantry, <i>different to</i> (though ‘found in writers of all
ages’—<i>Oxford Dictionary</i>) being on the whole the aggressor. With
<i>averse</i>, on the other hand, though the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>
gives a long roll of good names on each side, the use of <i>from</i>
may perhaps be said to strike most readers as a distinct protest
against the more natural <i>to</i>, so that <i>from</i> is here the
aggressor, and the pedantry, if it is pedantry, is offensive. Our
advice is to write <i>different from</i> and <i>averse to</i>. We
shall give a few examples, and add to them two sentences in which the
incorrect use of <i>from</i> with other words looks like the result
of insisting on the slightly artificial use of it after different and
averse.</p>

<p><i>Write</i> without <i>to</i> will now pass in commercial letters

neither ‘I will write you’ simply, nor ‘I wrote you that there was

only is the indirect object, but is unmistakably so at first sight.
It may be said that <i>I write you</i> is good old English. So is
<i>he was a-doing of it</i>; <i>I guess</i> is good Chaucerian. But in
neither case can the appeal to a dead usage—dead in polite society, or
in England—justify what is a modern vulgarism.</p>

<p>6. Compound prepositions and conjunctions.</p>

<p>The increasing use of these is much to be regretted. They, and the
love for abstract expression with which they are closely allied, are
responsible for much of what is flaccid, diffuse, and nerveless, in
modern writing. They are generally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span> no doubt, invented by persons who
want to express a more precise shade of meaning than they can find in
anything already existing; but they are soon caught up by others who
not only do not need the new delicate instrument, but do not understand
it. <i>Inasmuch</i> as, for instance, originally expressed that the
truth of its clause gave the exact measure of the truth that belonged
to the main sentence. So (from the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>God is only God inasmuch as he is the Moral Governor of the
world.—<span class="smcap">Sir W. Hamilton.</span></p>
</div>

<p>But long before Hamilton’s day the word passed, very naturally,
into the meaning, for which it need never have been invented, of
<i>since</i> or <i>because</i>. Consequently most people who need
the original idea have not the courage to use <i>inasmuch as</i>
for it, like Sir W. Hamilton, but resort to new combinations with
<i>far</i>. Those new combinations, however, as will be shown,
fluctuate and are confused with one another. The best thing we can
now do with <i>inasmuch</i> as is to get it decently buried; when it
means <i>since</i>, <i>since</i> is better; when it means what it
once meant, no one understands it. The moral we wish to draw is that
these compounds should be left altogether alone except in passages
where great precision is wanted. Just as a word like <i>save</i>
(except) is ruined for the poet by being used on every page of ordinary
prose (which it disfigures in revenge for its own degradation), so
<i>inasmuch</i> as is spoilt for the logician.</p>

<p>We shall first illustrate the absurd prevailing abuse of the compound
preposition <i>as to</i>. In each of the following sentences, if <i>as
to</i> is simply left out, no difference whatever is made in the
meaning. It is only familiarity with unnecessary circumlocution that
makes such a state of things tolerable to any one with a glimmering
of literary discernment. <i>As to</i> flows from the pen now at every
possible opportunity, till many writers seem quite unaware that such
words as <i>question</i> or <i>doubt</i> can bear the weight of a
<i>whether</i>-clause without help from this offensive parasite.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the worst of all. The subject of <i>makes</i> (anticipated in
the ordinary way by <i>it</i>) is <i>who says a thing</i>; but the
construction is obscured by the insertion of <i>as to</i>. We are
forced to suppose, wrongly, that <i>it</i> means <i>what brings me

wrong, is an instance that we find while correcting this sheet for the

<p>... Although it is open to doubt as to what extent individual saving

</div>

<p>Another objection to the compound prepositions and conjunctions is
that they are frequently confused with one another or miswritten. We
illustrate from two sets. (<i>a</i>) The word <i>view</i> is common
in the forms <i>in view of</i>, <i>with a view to</i>, <i>with the
view of</i>. The first expresses external circumstances, existing or
likely to occur, that must be taken into account; as, <i>In view of
these doubts about the next dividend, we do not recommend</i>.... The
other two both express the object aimed at, but must not have the
correspondence, <i>a</i> view <i>to</i>, <i>the</i> view <i>of</i>,
upset.</p>

<p>My company has been approached by several firms <i>with a view of</i>

</div>

<p>Of these the first is correct; but the sentence it comes in is so
typical of the compound-prepositional style that no one who reads it
will be surprised that its patrons should sometimes get mixed; how
should people who write like that keep their ideas clear? The second
should have <i>with a view to</i>. Still more should the third, which
is ambiguous as well as unidiomatic; the words used ought to mean
<i>seeing that her interests are safeguarded already</i>. The fourth
and fifth should again have <i>with a view to</i> (or <i>with the view
of</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The combinations with <i>far</i>—<i>as far as</i>, <i>so
far as</i>, <i>so far that</i>, <i>in so far as</i>, <i>in so far
that</i>, of which the last is certainly, and the last but one probably
needless—have some distinctions and limitations often neglected. For
instance, <i>as far as</i> must not be followed by a mere noun except
in the literal sense, <i>as far as London</i>. <i>So far as</i> and
<i>so far that</i> are distinguished by good writers in being applied,
the first to clauses that contain a doubtful or varying fact, the other
to clauses containing an ascertained or positive fact. <i>So far as</i>
(and <i>in so far as</i>), that is, means <i>to whatever extent</i>,
and <i>so far that</i> means <i>to this extent, namely that</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Certain Types of Humour</span></h3>

<p>Some of the more obvious devices of humorous writers, being fatally
easy to imitate, tend to outlive their natural term, and to become
a part of the injudicious novice’s stock-in-trade. <i>Olfactory
organ</i>, once no doubt an agreeable substitute for ‘nose’, has ceased
to be legal tender in literature, and is felt to mark a low level in
conversation. No amount of classical authority can redeem a phrase that
has once reached this stage. The warmest of George Eliot’s admirers,
called upon to swallow some tough morsel of polysyllabic humour in a
twentieth-century novel, will refuse to be comforted with parallel
passages from <i>Adam Bede</i>. Loyalty may smother the ejaculation
that ‘George Eliot knew no better’: it is none the less clear to him
that we know better now. A few well-worn types are illustrated below.</p>

<p>a. Polysyllabic humour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was a boy whom Mrs. Hackit had pronounced stocky (a word that
etymologically, in all probability, conveys some allusion to an
instrument of punishment for the refractory).—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<p>Tommy was a saucy boy, impervious to all impressions of reverence,
and excessively addicted to humming-tops and marbles, with which
recreative resources he was in the habit of immoderately distending
the pockets of his corduroys.—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<p>No one save an individual not in a condition to distinguish a hawk
from a handsaw....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>And an observer of Miss Tox’s proceedings might have inferred so much
without declaratory confirmation.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.</span></p>

<p>But it had its little inconveniences at other times, among which
may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span> enumerated the occasional appearance of the river in the
drawing-room, and the contemporaneous disappearance of the lawn and
shrubbery.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.</span></p>

<p>They might be better employed in composing their quarrels and
preparing a policy than in following the rather lugubrious occupations
indicated by Mr. Asquith.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Or perhaps, from a presentiment of calves’ brains, you refrain
from any lacteal addition, and rasp your tongue with unmitigated
bohea.—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<p>The rooks were cawing with many-voiced monotony, apparently—by
a remarkable approximation to human intelligence—finding great
conversational resources in the change of weather.—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<p>I had been terribly shaken by my fall, and had subsequently, owing to
the incision of the surgeon’s lancet, been deprived of much of the
vital fluid.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>

<p>An elderly man stood near me, and a still more elderly female
was holding a phial of very pungent salts to my olfactory
organ.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>

<p>The minister, honest man, was getting on his boots in the kitchen to

habiliments, and exhorted upon that score to fit ourselves more

</div>

<p>b. Playful repetition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When she had banged out the tune slowly, she began a different manner
of ‘Gettin’ up Stairs’, and did so with a fury and swiftness quite
incredible. She spun up stairs; she whirled up stairs; she galloped up
stairs; she rattled up stairs.... Then Miss Wirt played the ‘Gettin’
up Stairs’ with the most pathetic and ravishing solemnity.... Miss
Wirt’s hands seemed to faint and wail and die in variations: again,
and she went up with a savage clang and rush of trumpets, as if Miss
Wirt was storming a breach.—<span class="smcap">Thackeray.</span></p>

<p>My mind was, to a certain extent, occupied with the marks on the

<p>The pastrycook is hard at work in the funereal room in Brook Street,
and the very tall young men are busy looking on. One of the very tall
young men already smells of sherry, and his eyes have a tendency to
become fixed in his head, and to stare at objects without seeing them.
The very tall young man is conscious of this failing in himself; and
informs his comrade that it’s his ‘exciseman’. The very tall young man
would say excitement, but his speech is hazy.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></span></p>

<p>Busy is Mrs. Miff this morning at the church-door, beating and dusting
the altar-cloth, the carpet and the cushions; and much has Mrs. Miff
to say about the wedding they are going to have. Mrs. Miff is told
that the new furniture and alterations in the house cost full five
thousand pound, if they cost a penny; and Mrs. Miff has heard, upon
the best authority, that the lady hasn’t got a sixpence wherewithal to
bless herself. Mrs. Miff remembers, likewise, as if it had happened
yesterday, the first wife’s funeral, and then the christening, and
then the other funeral; and Mrs. Miff says, By-the-bye, she’ll
soap-and-water that ’ere tablet presently, against the company
arrive.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Dombey was a grave sight, behind the decanters, in a state of
dignity; and the East India Director was a forlorn sight, near the
unoccupied end of the table, in a state of solitude; and the major
was a military sight, relating stories of the Duke of York to six of
the seven mild men (the ambitious one was utterly quenched); and the
Bank Director was a lowly sight, making a plan of his little attempt
at a pinery, with dessert knives, for a group of admirers; and Cousin
Feenix was a thoughtful sight, as he smoothed his long wristbands and
stealthily adjusted his wig.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.</span></p>

<p>The author is very much at his ease in the last example; the novice

<p>It may be doubted whether any resemblance or contrast, however
striking, can make it worth a modern writer’s while to call waiters
Ganymedes, waitresses Hebes, postmen Mercuries, cabmen Automedons or
Jehus. In Scott’s time, possibly, these phrases had still an agreeable
novelty: they are now so hackneyed as to have fallen into the hands of
writers who are not quite certain who Ganymede and Hebe were. Thus,
there are persons who evidently think that it is rather complimentary
to one’s host than otherwise to call him an Amphitryon; and others who
are fond of using the phrase ‘l’Amphitryon où l’on dîne’ altogether
without point, apparently under the impression that ‘où l’on dîne’ is
an alternative version for the use of the uninitiated (‘Amphitryon’,
that is to say, ‘one’s host’).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Elegant Variation</span></h3>

<p>We include under this head all substitutions of one word for another
for the sake of variety, and some miscellaneous examples will be found
at the end of the section. But we are chiefly concerned with what may
be called pronominal variation, in which the word avoided is either a
noun or its obvious pronoun substitute. The use of pronouns is itself
a form of variation, designed to avoid ungainly repetition; and we
are only going one step further when, instead of either the original
noun or the pronoun, we use some new equivalent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> ‘Mr. Gladstone’,
for instance, having already become ‘he,’ presently appears as ‘that
statesman’. Variation of this kind is often necessary in practice; so
often, that it should never be admitted except when it is necessary.
Many writers of the present day abound in types of variation that are
not justified by expediency, and have consequently the air of cheap
ornament. It is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules, but two
general principles may be suggested: (1) Variation should take place
only when there is some awkwardness, such as ambiguity or noticeable
monotony, in the word avoided. (2) The substitute should be of a purely
pronominal character, a substitute and nothing more; there should be no
killing of two birds with one stone. Even when these two requirements
are satisfied, the variation is often worse, because more noticeable,
than the monotony it is designed to avoid.</p>

<p>The examples in our first group do not offend against (2): how far
they offend against (1), and how far they are objectionable on other
grounds, we shall consider in detail.</p>

dramatist</i> still holds his own with the publishers. The last two or
three weeks have seen two new editions of him.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The writer has thoroughly puzzled himself. He cannot call Shakespeare
Shakespeare, because there is a Shakespeare just before: he cannot call
him <i>he</i>, because six other persons in the sentence have claims
upon <i>he</i>: and he ought not to call him <i>the dramatist</i>,
because Aeschylus and Sophocles were dramatists too. We know, of
course, which dramatist is meant, just as we should have known which
<i>he</i> was meant; but the appropriation is awkward in either
case. <i>The dramatist</i> is no doubt the best thing under the
circumstances; but when matters are brought to such a pass that we can
neither call a man by his own name, nor use a pronoun, nor identify him
by means of his profession, it is time to remodel the sentence.</p>

</div>

<p>Elegant variation is the last thing we should expect here. For what
is the writer’s principal object? Clearly, to emphasize the idea of
reciprocity by the repetition of names, and by their arrangement. Mr.
Chamberlain, Mr. Balfour: Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain. It is easy
enough, so far: ‘If Mr. Chamberlain has been injured by the persistent
attachment of Mr. Balfour, Mr. Balfour has been equally injured by
that of Mr. Chamberlain’. But that is not all that is required: there
is to be the graphic touch; arm is to be locked in arm. Now comes the
difficulty: in whose arm are we to lock Mr. Chamberlain’s? in ‘his’? in
‘<i>his</i>’? in ‘his own’? in ‘Mr. Balfour’s’? in ‘that of the Prime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Minister’? As the locking of arms is perhaps after all only an elegant
variation for clinging, remodelling seems again to be the best way out
of the difficulty. Perhaps our simplified form above might serve.</p>

Clarence Barracks. <i>The King</i> returned to London in the course of
the afternoon.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This is, no doubt, a difficult case. The royal pronoun (His Majesty)
does not lend itself to repetition: on the other hand, it is felt that
<i>he</i>s, if indulged in at all, must be kept a respectful distance
apart; hence <i>The King</i> in the third sentence. We can get rid of
it by reading ‘... at Clarence Barracks; returning ...’. But of course
that solution would not always be possible.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>It is natural that <i>Sir Charles Edward Bernard</i> should be
introduced to us under his full name; natural, also, that an
abbreviation should be chosen for working purposes. But why two
abbreviations? If <i>Sir Charles</i> and <i>he</i> are judiciously
employed, they will last out to the end of the longest article, without
any assistance from <i>Sir Edward</i>.</p>

<p>Among the instances here given, there is scarcely one in which
variation might not have been avoided with a little trouble. There are
some, indeed, in which it is not gratuitous; and if in these the effect
upon the reader were as negative as the writer’s intention, there would
be nothing to complain of. But it is not; the artistic concealment
of art is invariably wanting. These elephantine shifts distract our
attention from the matter in hand; we cannot follow His Majesty’s
movements, for wondering what the King will be called next time; will
it be plain Edward VII? or will something be done, perhaps, with ‘the
Emperor of India’? When the choice lies between monotonous repetition
on the one hand and clumsy variation on the other, it may fairly be
laid down that of two undesirable alternatives the natural is to be
preferred to the artificial.</p>

<p>But variation of this kind is, at the worst, less offensive than
that which, in violation of our second principle above, is employed
as a medium for the conveyance of sprightly allusion, mild humour or

<h3><span class="smcap">Inversion</span></h3>

<p>Of all the types of inversion used by modern writers, there is perhaps
not one that could not be shown to exist in older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> English. Ordinary
modern usage, however, has retained those forms only in which ancient
authority combines with practical convenience; and not all of those.
To set aside the verdict of time in this respect is to be archaic.
Before using inversion, therefore, the novice should ask himself two
questions: is there any solid, practical reason (ornamental reasons
will not do) for tampering with the normal order of subject and verb?
and does the inversion sound natural?</p>

<p>Throughout this section it must be borne in mind that in all questions
of right and wrong inversion the final appeal is not to history, but
to the reader’s perception: what sounds right to most modern ears is
right for modern purposes. When, under balance inversion, we speak of
a true and a false principle, we do not mean to imply that the ‘true’
principle was, historically, the origin of this kind of inversion, or
that the ‘false’ is a mistaken analogy from it: all that is meant is
that if we examine a collection of instances, those that sound natural
will prove to be based upon the ‘true’ principle, and those that do not
on the ‘false’.</p>

<p><b>a. Exclamatory inversion.</b></p>

<p>This may be regarded as an abbreviated form of exclamation, as if
the word ‘How’ had dropped out at the beginning, and a note of
exclamation at the end. The inverted order, which is normal in the
complete exclamation, sounds natural also in the abbreviated form. The
requirements for this kind of inversion are these: (1) The intention
must be genuinely exclamatory, so that the full form of exclamation
could be substituted without extravagance. (2) The word placed first
must be that which would bear the chief emphasis in the uninverted
form. It should be observed that this is the only kind of inversion in
which the emphatic word, as such, stands at the beginning.</p>

<p>Our first three examples satisfy these conditions, and are
unobjectionable. The fourth does not: we could not substitute ‘With
what difficulty...!’; nor are the first words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span> emphatic; the emphasis
is on ‘conceive’. Yet the inversion is inoffensive, being in fact not
exclamatory at all, but a licensed extension of negative inversion,
which is treated below.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bitterly did I regret the perverse, superstitious folly that had
induced me to neglect so obvious a precaution.</p>

<p>But in these later times, with so many disillusions, with fresh

of faith with which Haeckel regards his work.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Gladly would he now have consented to the terms....</p>

<p>With difficulty can I conceive of a mental condition in which....</p>
</div>

<p>Exclamatory inversion, like everything else that is exclamatory, should
of course be used sparingly.</p>

<p><b>b. Balance inversion.</b></p>

<p>The following are familiar and legitimate types:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First on our list stands the question of local option.</p>

<p>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>

<p>To this cause may be attributed....</p>

<p>Among the guests were A, B, C, ... Z.</p>
</div>

<p>We give the name of ‘balance’ to this kind of inversion because,
although the writer, in inverting the sentence, may not be distinctly
conscious of rectifying its balance, the fact that it was ill-balanced
before is the true cause of inversion. It is a mistake to say that the
words placed first in the above examples are so placed for the sake
of emphasis; that is a very common impression, and is responsible for
many unlawful inversions. It is not emphasis that is given to these
words, it is protection; they are placed there to protect them from
being virtually annihilated, as they would have been if left at the
end. Look at the last of our examples: how can we call the words ‘Among
the guests were’ emphatic, or say that they were placed there for
emphasis? They are essential words, they show the connexion, nor could
the sentence be a sentence without them; but they are as unemphatic as
words could well be.—Why, then (it may be asked), are they put at the
beginning? is not this an emphatic position? and does not any unusual
position give emphasis?—No: it gives not emphasis but prominence,
which is another thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Put the sentence back into its original form, and we shall see why
inversion was desirable. ‘A, B, C, D, E, F ... Z were among the
guests.’ Observe how miserably the sentence tails off; it has no
balance. By inverting it, we introduce several improvements. First, we
give prominence to the unemphatic predicate, and enable it to discharge
its humble office, that of a sign-post, indicating the connexion with
what has gone before. Secondly, by giving prominence to the predicate,
we give balance to the sentence, which before was top-heavy. Thirdly,
we give prominence to the subject, by placing it in an unusual position.</p>

<p>Next take the ‘local option’ sentence. Are the words ‘First on our
list’ emphatic? Not if the inverter knows his business. How did it run
originally? ‘The question of local option stands first on our list.’
These words might be meant to tell us either of two things: what stood
first on the list, or where local option stood. If the inversion is
right, they are meant to tell us what stood first. If the other had
been meant, then ‘First on the list’ would have been emphatic, and the
writer would have left it in its place; but as it is not emphatic, and
the other words are, the sentence is top-heavy; he therefore inverts
it, thus balancing the sentence, and placing the unemphatic words in
a prominent position, where they continue to be unemphatic, but are
sure to be noticed. In spoken language, the relative importance of the
different parts of a sentence can be indicated merely by the inflexion
of the voice; but the balance of the sentence is best maintained, even
then, by means of inversion.</p>

<p>It is the same with the other examples. If we restore the St. Matthew
quotation to the uninverted form, again we have an answer to either of
two questions: What is the basis of the law? and What is the importance
of these two commandments? Obviously it is meant as an answer to
the latter, and therefore the words that convey that answer are the
emphatic words; the others are not emphatic, but merely essential to
the connexion; the general importance of the ‘two commandments’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
as forming the subject-matter of the whole context, does not in the
slightest degree affect their relation to the other words in this
particular sentence.</p>

<p>It follows from what has been said that true balance inversion is
employed not for the sake of impressiveness, but with the purely
negative object of avoiding a bad balance. The data required for its
justification are (i) An emphatic subject, carrying in itself the point
of the sentence, (ii) Unemphatic ‘sign-post’ words, essential to the
connexion, standing originally at the end of the sentence, and there
felt to be inadequately placed. The results of the inversion must be
(iii) That the sign-post stands at the beginning, (iv) That the subject
stands absolutely at the end.</p>

<p>When these four conditions are fulfilled, the inversion, far from being
objectionable, may tend greatly to vigour and lucidity. It is liable,
of course, to be overdone, but there are several ways of avoiding
that: sometimes it is possible to place the sign-post at the beginning
without inversion; or the uninverted sentence may be reconstructed, so
that the subject no longer carries the emphasis; and, as often as not,
a sentence of which the accentuation is theoretically doubtful may in
practice be left to the reader’s discernment.</p>

<p>One occasional limitation remains to be mentioned, before we proceed
to instances. It applies to those sentences only that have a compound
verb: if the compound verb cannot be represented simply by its
auxiliary component, the inversion may have to be abandoned, on account
of the clumsiness of compound verbs in the middle of an inverted
sentence, for to carry the other component to the end would be to
violate our fourth rule. Take the type sentence ‘To these causes may
be attributed ...’, and first let the subject be ‘our disasters’. The
clumsiness of the verb is then distinctly felt; and ‘To these causes
may our disasters be attributed’ is ugly enough to show the importance
of the rule it violates. But next let the subject be ‘every one of
the disasters that have come upon us’. This time the inversion is
satisfactory; whence we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> conclude that if the verb is compound, the
subject must be long as well as emphatic, or the inversion will not do.</p>

</div>

<p>These are both formed on the right principle, but the second suffers

</div>

<p>Here we have neither the data that justify balance inversion, nor the
results that should follow from it. It is due to the false principle
of ‘emphasis’ dealt with below in d. and reads as awkwardly as such
inversions usually read. The sentence is, no doubt, cumbrous in the
uninverted form; but it wants reconstruction, not inversion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Much deeper down than the history of the human race must we go to find
the beginnings of these connections.—<span class="smcap">Spencer.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Wrong again, for the same reasons, but not with the same excuse; for
the original form is unobjectionable. The emphasis is not on the
problem (<i>to find</i> ...), but on the clue to it (<i>much deeper
down</i>), which, being emphatic, can maintain its position at the end
of the sentence. The compound verb is only a secondary objection: we do
not mend matters much by substituting <i>lie</i> for <i>must we go to
find</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You say he is selfish. Well, so is every one.</p>

<p>You say he is selfish. Well, so is every one selfish.</p>
</div>

<p><i>So is every one</i> is a correct inversion: <i>so</i> is too weak to
stand at the end, and at the beginning it is a good enough sign-post to
tell us that selfishness is going to be defended. But <i>so is every
one selfish</i> is wrong: for if <i>selfish</i> is repeated at all, it
is repeated with rhetorical effect, and is strong enough to take care
of itself. Our second rule is thus violated; and so is our fourth—the
subject does not come at the end.</p>

Falconet family, both among the sons and the daughters. Especially was

Miss Hartmann.—<span class="smcap">Beaconsfield.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Right or wrong in principle, this does not read comfortably; but that
may seem to be due to the cumbrous phrase ‘was there no lack of’, which
for practical purposes is a compound verb. That difficulty we can
remove without disturbing the accentuation of the sentence: ‘Especially
numerous were the speculations as to the character of Miss Hartmann’.
This resembles in form our old type ‘Among the guests were ...’, but
with the important difference that ‘especially numerous’ is emphatic,
and can therefore stand at the end. The inversion is rather explained
than justified by the still stronger emphasis on ‘Miss Hartmann’.
Sentences in which both subject and predicate are independently
emphatic should be avoided, quite apart from the question of inversion:
italics are more or less necessary to secure the inferior emphasis, and
italics are a confession of weakness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Somewhat lightened was the <i>provincial</i> panic by this proof that
the murderer had not condescended to sneak into the country, or to
abandon for a moment, under any motion of caution or fear, the great
metropolitan <i>castra stativa</i> of gigantic crime seated for ever
on the Thames.—<span class="smcap">De Quincey</span> (the italics are his).</p>
</div>

<p>Not a happy attempt. We notice, for one thing, that the subject does
not come at the end; the inversion is not complete. Let us complete it.
To do so, we must convey our huge sign-post to the beginning: ‘By this
proof ... Thames, was somewhat lightened the <i>provincial</i> panic.’
Worse than ever; is the compound verb to blame? Remove it, and see:
‘In consequence of this proof ... Thames, subsided in some degree the
<i>provincial</i> panic’. This is not much better. There is another
and a worse flaw: condition number one is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> satisfied; we want ‘an
emphatic subject that carries in itself the point of the sentence’. Now
we must not assume that because ‘provincial’ is italicized, therefore
the subject (however emphatic) carries in itself the point of the
sentence. What is that point? what imaginary question does the sentence
answer? Can it be meant to answer the question ‘What limitations were
there upon the comfort derived from the intelligence that the murderer
was still in London?’? No; that question could not be asked; we have
not yet been told that any comfort at all was derived. The question
it answers is ‘What effect did this intelligence produce upon the
general panic?’. This question can be asked; for the reader evidently
knows that a panic had prevailed, and that the intelligence had come.
If, then, we are to use balance inversion, we must so reconstruct
the sentence that the words containing the essential answer to this
question become the subject; we must change ‘somewhat lightened’
into ‘some alleviation’. ‘From this proof ... Thames, resulted some
alleviation of the <i>provincial</i> panic.’ That is the best that
inversion will do for us; it is not quite satisfactory, and the reason
is that the sentence is made to do too much. When the essential point
is subject to an emphatic limitation (an unemphatic one like ‘somewhat’
does not matter), the limitation ought to be conveyed in a separate
sentence; otherwise the sentence is overworked, and either shirks its
work, with the result of obscurity, or protests by means of italics.
We ought therefore to have: ‘From ... resulted some alleviation of the
general panic; this, however, was confined to the provinces’. But,
except for this incidental fault, the sentence can be mended without
inversion: ‘By this proof ... Thames, the <i>provincial</i> panic was
somewhat lightened’.</p>

<p><b>c. Inversion in syntactic clauses.</b></p>

<p>In clauses introduced by <i>as</i>, <i>than</i>, or a relative (pronoun
or adverb), we have only a special case of balance inversion. They
differ from the instances considered above in this important respect,
that their relation to the preceding words is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> no longer paratactic,
but syntactic, with the result that the sign-post indicating this
relation is necessarily placed at the beginning. This will be seen from
a comparison of the paratactic and syntactic forms in the following
pairs of examples:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was quick-tempered: so are most Irishmen. (Paratactic.)</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was quick-tempered, as are most Irishmen. (Syntactic.)</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Several difficulties now arose: among them was....</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Several difficulties now arose, among which was....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now in each of these sentences there are the same inducements to
inversion in the syntactic form as in the paratactic; and added to
these is the necessity for placing the sign-post at the beginning. We
might expect, therefore, that inversion of syntactic clauses would be
particularly common. But (i) We have already seen that inversion does
not necessarily follow from the fact that the sign-post is placed at
the beginning. And (ii) The verb in <i>as</i> and <i>than</i> clauses
will probably, from the nature of the case, be the same as in the
preceding clause. If it is in the same mood and tense, it can usually
be omitted, unless effective repetition is required, in which case it
will go to the end: a change of mood or tense, on the other hand, will
often be marked by an auxiliary (itself perhaps compound), which again
will usually preclude inversion.</p>

<p>The result is this:</p>

<p>i. Relative clauses, uninfluenced by the position of the sign-post,
remain subject to precisely the same conditions as the corresponding
paratactic sentences. Thus ‘Among whom were....’ is right, just
as ‘Among the guests were....’ was right; ‘Among which would I
mention....’ is of course impossible, because the subject does not
carry the point; and ‘To which may be attributed....’ is right or
wrong, according as the subject is or is not long enough to balance the
compound verb.</p>

<p>ii. Inversion of an <i>as</i> or <i>than</i> clause, having become
unusual for the reason mentioned above, is almost certain to look
either archaic or clumsy; clumsy when the reason for it is apparent,
archaic when it is not. The practical rule is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> this: if you cannot omit
the verb, put it at the end; and if you can neither omit it nor put it
at the end, reconstruct the sentence.</p>

<p><b>d. Negative inversion, and false ‘emphasis’ inversion.</b></p>

<p>The connexion here suggested between certain forms of inversion must
be taken to represent, not by any means the historical order of
development, with which we are not directly concerned, but the order
in which a modern writer may be supposed, more or less unconsciously,
to adopt them. Starting from an isolated case of necessary inversion,
we proceed to extensions of it that seem natural and are sanctioned
by modern usage; and from these to other extensions, based probably
on a misunderstanding, and producing in modern writers the effect of
archaism.</p>

<p><i>Nor</i>, except when used in conjunction with <i>neither</i>, always
stands first; and if the subject appears at all, the sentence is always
inverted. This requires no illustration.</p>

<p>On the analogy of <i>nor</i>, many other negative words and phrases are
thrown to the beginning of the sentence, and again inversion is the
result.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

from the other, and of neither of which can any proof be

</div>

<p>It is at this stage that misconception creeps in. Most of these
negative phrases are in themselves emphatic; and from their being
placed first (really on the analogy of <i>nor</i>) comes the mistaken
idea that they derive emphasis from their position. This paves the way
for wholesale inversion: any words, other than the subject, are placed
at the beginning; and this not always in order to emphasize the words
so placed, but merely to give an impressive effect to the whole. The
various steps are marked by the instances that follow. In the first
two, inversion may be on the analogy of negatives, or may be designed
for emphasis; in the third, emphasis is clearly the motive; and in the
rest we have mere impressiveness—not to say mere mannerism.</p>

<p>In view of the rapidly increasing tendency to causeless inversion of

<p>(i) In narrated dialogue, the demand for variations of ‘he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> said’, &amp;c.,
excuse considerable freedom in the matter of inversion. One or two
points, however, may be noticed.</p>

<p>When the subject is a personal pronoun, <i>say</i> is perhaps the
only verb with which inversion is advisable. ‘Said I, he, they’, and
‘retorted Jones’: but not ‘enquired I’, ‘rejoined he’, ‘suggested they’.</p>

<p>Compound verbs, as usual, do not lend themselves to inversion:</p>

</div>

<p>Inverted <i>said</i> at the beginning is one of the first pitfalls
that await the novice who affects sprightliness. It is tolerable, if
anywhere, only in light playful verse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(ii) The inverted conditionals <i>should</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>could</i>,

and a certain neatness, are all more or less licensed by modern usage.
It is worth while, however, to name them in what seems to be their
order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> of merit. <i>Should I</i>, from its frequency, is without taint
of archaism; but <i>could</i> and <i>would</i>, and, in a less degree,
<i>had</i>, are apt to betray their archaic character by the addition
of <i>but</i> (‘would he but consent’); and <i>were</i> and <i>did</i>
are felt to be slightly out of date, even without this hint.</p>

<p>(iii) Always, after performing inversion of any kind, the novice
should go his rounds, and see that all is shipshape. For want of this
precaution, a writer who was no novice, particularly in the matter of
inversion, produces such curiosities as these:</p>

<p>We shall venture on removing the comma before ‘though’; but must leave
it to connoisseurs in inversion to decide between the rival attractions
of ‘disagree with M. Comte though I do’ and ‘disagreeing ... though I
am’. ‘Though I do’, in spite of the commas, can scarcely be meant to be
parenthetic; that would give (by resolution of the participle) ‘though
I disagree with M. Comte, though I do, ....’</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Archaism</span></h3>

<p><b>a. Occasional.</b></p>

<p>We have implied in former sections, and shall here take it for granted,
that occasional archaism is always a fault, conscious or unconscious.
There are, indeed, a few writers—Lamb is one of them—whose
uncompromising terms, ‘Love me, love my archaisms’, are generally
accepted; but they are taking risks that a novice will do well not to
take.</p>

<p>As to unconscious archaism, it might be thought that such a thing could
scarcely exist: to employ unconsciously a word that has been familiar,
and is so no longer, can happen to few.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span> Yet charitable readers will
believe that in the following sentence <i>demiss</i> has slipped
unconsciously from a learned pen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He perceived that the Liberal ministry had offended certain
influential sections by appearing too demiss or too unenterprising in
foreign affairs.—<span class="smcap">Bryce.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The guilt of such peccadilloes as this may be said to vary inversely
as the writer’s erudition; for in this matter the learned may plead
ignorance, where the novice knows too well what he is doing. It is
conscious archaism that offends, above all the conscious archaisms
of the illiterate: the historian’s <i>It should seem</i>, even
the essayist’s <i>You shall find</i>, is less odious, though not
less deliberate, than the <i>ere</i>, <i>oft</i>, <i>aught</i>,
<i>thereanent</i>, <i>I wot</i>, <i>I trow</i>, and similar ornaments,
with which amateurs are fond of tricking out their sentences. This is
only natural. An educated writer’s choice falls upon archaisms less
hackneyed than the amateur’s; he uses them, too, with more discretion,
limiting his favourites to a strict allowance, say, of once in three
essays. The amateur indulges us with his whole repertoire in a single
newspaper letter of twenty or thirty lines, and—what is worse—cannot
live up to the splendours of which he is so lavish: charmed with the
discovery of some antique order of words, he selects a modern slang
phrase to operate upon; he begins a sentence with <i>ofttimes</i>,
and ends it with a grammatical blunder; aspires to <i>albeit</i>, and
achieves <i>howbeit</i>. Our list begins with the educated specimens,
but lower down the reader will find several instances of this fatal
incongruity of style; fatal, because the culprit proves himself
unworthy of what is worthless. For the vilest of trite archaisms has
this latent virtue, that it might be worse; to use it, and by using it
to make it worse, is to court derision.</p>

<p><b>b. Sustained archaism in narrative and dialogue.</b></p>

<p>A novelist who places his story in some former age may do so for
the sake of a purely superficial variety, without any intention of
troubling himself or his readers with temporal colour more than is
necessary to avoid glaring absurdities; he is then not concerned with
archaism at all. More commonly, however, it is part of his plan to
present a living picture of the time of which he writes. When this
is the case, he naturally feels bound to shun anachronism not only
in externals, but in thought and the expression of thought. Now with
regard to the language of his characters, it would be absurd for him
to pretend to anything like consistent realism: he probably has no
accurate knowledge of the language as his characters would speak it;
and if he had this knowledge, and used it, he would be unintelligible
to most of his readers, and burdensome to the rest. Accordingly, if he
is wise, he will content himself with keeping clear of such modes of
expression as are essentially modern and have only modern associations,
such as would jar upon the reader’s sense of fitness and destroy the
time illusion. He will aim, that is to say, at a certain archaic
directness and simplicity; but with the archaic vocabulary, which
instead of preserving the illusion only reminds us that there is an
illusion to be preserved, he will have little to do. This we may call
negative archaism. <i>Esmond</i> is an admirable example of it, and
the ‘Dame Gossip’ part of Mr. Meredith’s <i>Amazing Marriage</i> is
another. It hardly occurs to us in these books that the language is
archaic; it is appropriate, that is all. The same may be said, on the
whole, of <i>Treasure Island</i>, and of one or two novels of Besant’s.</p>

<p>Only the novelist who is not wise indulges in positive archaism. He
is actuated by the determination to have everything in character at
all costs. He does not know very much about old English of any period;
very few people do, and those who know most of it would be the last to
attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> to write a narrative in it. He gives us, however, all that
he knows, without much reference to particular periods; it may not be
good ancient English, but, come what may, it shall not be good modern.
This, it need scarcely be said, is not fair play: the recreation is
all on the writer’s side. Archaism is, no doubt, very seductive to the
archaist. Well done (that is, negatively done), it looks easy; and to
do it badly is perhaps even easier than it looks. No very considerable
stock-in-trade is required; the following will do quite well:
Prithee—quotha—perchance—peradventure—i’ faith—sirrah—beshrew
me—look ye—sith that—look to it—leave prating—it shall go hard
but—I tell you, but—the more part—fair cold water—to me-ward—I
am shrewdly afeared—it is like to go stiff with me—y’ are—y’
have—it irks me sorely—benison—staunch—gyves—yarely—this same
villain—drink me this—you were better go; to these may be added
the indiscriminate use of ‘Nay’ and ‘Now (by the rood, &amp;c.)’; free
inversion; and verb terminations in <i>-st</i> and <i>-th</i>. Our list
is largely drawn from Stevenson, who, having tried negative archaism
with success in <i>Treasure Island</i>, chose to give us a positive
specimen in <i>The Black Arrow</i>. How vexatious these reach-me-down
archaisms can become, even in the hands of an able writer, will be seen
from the following examples of a single trick, all taken from <i>The
Black Arrow</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An I had not been a thief, I could not have painted <i>me</i> your
face.</p>

<p>Put <i>me</i> your hand into the corner, and see what ye find there.</p>

<p>Bring <i>me</i> him down like a ripe apple. And keep ever forward,
Master Shelton; turn <i>me</i> not back again, an ye love your life.</p>

<p>Selden, take <i>me</i> this old shrew softly to the nearest elm, and
hang <i>me</i> him tenderly by the neck, where I may see him at my
riding.</p>

<p>Mark <i>me</i> this old villain on the piebald.</p>

<p>‘Sirrah, no more words,’ said Dick. ‘Bend <i>me</i> your back.’</p>

<p>‘Here is a piece of forest that I know not’, Dick remarked. ‘Where
goeth <i>me</i> this track?’</p>

<p>‘I slew him fair. I ran <i>me</i> in upon his bow,’ he cried.</p>

<p>‘Swallow <i>me</i> a good draught of this,’ said the knight.</p>
</div>

<p>It is like a child with a new toy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>But there is the opposite fault. The judicious archaist, as we
have said, will abstain from palpable modernisms, especially from
modern slang. The following extracts are taken from an old woman’s
reminiscences of days in which a ‘faultless attire’ included ‘half high
boots, knee-breeches very tight above the calf (as the fashion was
then), a long-tailed cutaway coat, ...’:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But the Captain, who, of course, lacks bowels of mercy for this kind
of thing, says that if he had been Caesar, ‘Caius would have <i>got
the great chuck</i>. Yes, madam, I would have broke Mister Caius on
the spot’.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>

<p>But if you once go in for <i>having a good time</i> (as Miss
Anne in her innocence used to remark) you must be prepared
to....—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>

<p>... as all girls love to do when they are content with the way they
have <i>put in their time</i>.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Metaphor</span></h3>

<p>Strictly speaking, metaphor occurs as often as we take a word out of
its original sphere and apply it to new circumstances. In this sense
almost all words can be shown to be metaphorical when they do not bear
a physical meaning; for the original meaning of almost all words can
be traced back to something physical; in our first sentence above, for
instance, there are eight different metaphors. Words had to be found
to express mental perceptions, abstract ideas, and complex relations,
for which a primitive vocabulary did not provide; and the obvious
course was to convey the new idea by means of the nearest physical
parallel. The commonest Latin verb for <i>think</i> is a metaphor from
vine-pruning; ‘seeing’ of the mind is borrowed from literal sight;
‘pondering’ is metaphorical ‘weighing’. Evidently these metaphors
differ in intention and effect from such a phrase as ‘smouldering’
discontent; the former we may call, for want of a better word,
‘natural’ metaphor, as opposed to the latter, which is artificial. The
word metaphor as ordinarily used suggests only the artificial kind: but
in deciding on the merits or demerits of a metaphorical phrase we are
concerned as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> with the one class as the other; for in all doubtful
cases our first questions will be, what was the writer’s intention in
using the metaphor? is it his own, or is it common property? if the
latter, did he use it consciously or unconsciously?</p>

<p>This distinction, however, is useful only as leading up to another.
We cannot use it directly as a practical test: artificial metaphors,
as well as natural ones, often end by becoming a part of ordinary
language; when this has happened, there is no telling to which class
they belong, and in English the question is complicated by the fact
that our metaphorical vocabulary is largely borrowed from Latin in the
metaphorical state. Take such a word as <i>explain</i>: its literal
meaning is ‘spread out flat’: how are we to say now whether necessity
or picturesqueness first prompted its metaphorical use? And the same
doubt might arise centuries hence as to the origin of a phrase so
obviously artificial to us as ‘glaring inconsistency’.</p>

<p>Our practical distinction will therefore be between conscious or
‘living’ and unconscious or ‘dead’ metaphor, whether natural or
artificial in origin: and again, among living metaphors, we shall
distinguish between the intentional, which are designed for effect,
and the unintentional, which, though still felt to be metaphors, are
used merely as a part of the ordinary vocabulary. It may seem at
first sight that this classification leaves us where we were: how can
we know whether a writer uses a particular metaphor consciously or
unconsciously? We cannot know for certain: it is enough if we think
that he used it consciously, and know that we should have used it
consciously ourselves; experience will tell us how far our perceptions
in this respect differ from other people’s. Most readers, we think,
will agree in the main with our classification of the following
instances; they are taken at random from a couple of pages of the
<i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>These we should call dead: ‘his <i>views</i> were personal’; ‘<i>carry
out</i> his policy’; ‘not <i>acceptable</i> to his <i>colleagues</i>’;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
‘the Chancellor <i>proposed</i>’; ‘some <i>grounds</i> for
<i>complaint</i>’; ‘<i>refrain</i> from talking about them’; ‘the
<i>remission</i> of the Tea-duty’; ‘<i>sound</i> policy’; ‘a speech
almost entirely <i>composed</i> of <i>extracts</i>’; ‘<i>reduction</i>
of taxation’; ‘<i>discussion</i>’; ‘the <i>low</i> price of Consols’;
‘<i>falls</i> due’; ‘<i>succeeded</i>’; ‘will <i>approach</i> their
task’; ‘<i>delivered</i> a speech’; ‘<i>postponing</i> to a future
year’. The next are living, but not intentional metaphor; the writer
is aware that his phrase is still picturesque in effect, but has
not chosen it for that reason: ‘a Protestant <i>atmosphere</i>’;
‘this would leave a <i>margin</i> of £122,000’; ‘the loss of
<i>elasticity</i>’ in the Fund; ‘<i>recasting</i> our whole
Fiscal system’; ‘to <i>uphold</i> the unity of the Empire’; ‘to
<i>strengthen</i> the Exchequer balances’; ‘all <i>dwelt</i> on the
grave injury’; ‘his somewhat <i>shattered</i> authority’; ‘the policy
of evasion now <i>pursued</i>’; ‘<i>throws</i> new <i>light</i> on
the situation’; ‘a <i>gap</i> in our fiscal system’. Intentional
metaphors are of course less plentiful: ‘the home-rule motion designed
to “<i>draw</i>” Sir Henry’; ‘a <i>dissolving view</i> of General
Elections’; ‘this reassuring declaration <i>knocks the bottom out
of</i> the plea of urgency’; ‘the <i>scattered remnants</i> of that
party might <i>rally after the disastrous defeat</i>’.</p>

<p>One or two general remarks may be made before we proceed to instances.
It is scarcely necessary to warn any one against over-indulgence in
intentional metaphor; its effects are too apparent. The danger lies
rather in the use of live metaphor that is not intentional. The many
words and phrases that fall under this class are all convenient; as
often as not they are the first that occur, and it is laborious,
sometimes impossible, to hit upon an equivalent; the novice will find
it worth while, however, to get one whenever he can. We may read a
newspaper through without coming upon a single metaphor of this kind
that is at all offensive in itself; it is in the aggregate that they
offend. ‘Cries aloud for’, ‘drop the curtain on’, ‘goes hand in hand
with’, ‘a note of warning’, leaves its impress’, ‘paves the way for’,
‘heralds the advent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> of’, ‘opens the door to’, are not themselves
particularly noisy phrases; but writers who indulge in them generally
end by being noisy.</p>

<p>Unintentional metaphor is the source, too, of most actual blunders.
Every one is on his guard when his metaphor is intentional; the
nonsense that is talked about mixed metaphor, and the celebrity of one
or two genuine instances of it that come down to us from the eighteenth
century, have had that good effect. There are few obvious faults a
novice is more afraid of committing than this of mixed metaphor. His
fears are often groundless; many a sentence that might have stood has
been altered from a misconception of what mixed metaphor really is. The
following points should be observed.</p>

<p>1. If only one of the metaphors is a live one, the confusion is not a
confusion for practical purposes.</p>

<p>2. Confusion can only exist between metaphors that are grammatically
inseparable; parallel metaphors between which there is no grammatical
dependence cannot result in confusion. The novice must beware, however,
of being misled either by punctuation or by a parallelism that does not
secure grammatical independence. Thus, no amount of punctuation can
save the time-honoured example ‘I smell a rat: I see him hovering in
the air: ... I will nip him in the bud’. <i>Him</i> is inseparable from
the later metaphors, and refers to the rat. But there is no confusion
in the following passage; any one of the metaphors can be removed
without affecting the grammar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This fortress built by Nature for herself ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This happy breed of men, this little world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This precious stone set in the silver sea, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, ...</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>3. Metaphor within metaphor is dangerous. Here there is a grammatical
dependence between the metaphors, and if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> combination is unsuitable
confusion will result. But combination is one thing, and confusion
is another: if the internal metaphor is not inconsistent with the
external, there is no confusion, though there may be ugliness. To adapt
one of our examples below, ‘The Empire’s butcher (i. e. New Zealand)
has not all his eggs in one basket’ is not a confusion, because a
metaphorical butcher can have his eggs in one basket as well as any one
else. What does lead to confusion is the choice of an internal metaphor
applicable not to the words of the external metaphor, but to the
literal words for which it is substituted. In the following example,
the confusion is doubtless intended.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This pillar of the state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath swallowed hook and bait.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The swallowing is applicable only to the person metaphorically called a
pillar.</p>

<p>4. Confusion of metaphor is sometimes alleged against sentences that
contain only one metaphor—a manifest absurdity. These are really
cases of a clash between the metaphorical and the non-metaphorical.
A striking or original metaphor is apt to appear violent, and a
commonplace one impertinent, if not adequately borne out by the rest of
the sentence. This we may label ‘unsustained metaphor’. It sometimes
produces much the same effect as mixed metaphor; but the remedy for
it, as well as the cause, is different. Mixed metaphor is the result
of negligence, and can generally be put right by a simple adaptation
of the language to whichever metaphor is to be retained. Unsustained
metaphor is rather an error of judgement: it is unsustained either
because it was difficult to sustain, or because it was not worth
sustaining; in either case abandonment is the simplest course.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This diverting incident contributed in a high degree to the general
merriment.</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have four different metaphors; but as they are all dead, there
is no real confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This, as you know, was a burning question; and its unseasonable
introduction threw a chill on the spirits of all our party.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Burning</i> and <i>chill</i> are both live metaphors, they are
grammatically connected by <i>its</i>, and they are inconsistent; there
is therefore confusion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The uncertainty which hangs over every battle extends in a special
degree to battles at sea.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Extends</i> is usually dead; and if in this case it is living, it is
also suitable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A centre and nucleus round which the scattered remnants of that party
might rally after the disastrous defeat.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The main or external metaphor is that of an army. Now any metaphor that
is applicable to a literal army is also applicable to a metaphorical
one: but ‘rally round a nucleus’ is a confusion of metaphor, to
whichever it is applied; it requires us to conceive of the army at the
same time as animal and vegetable, <i>nucleus</i> being literally the
kernel of a nut, and metaphorically a centre about which growth takes
place. An army can have a nucleus, but cannot rally round it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir W. Laurier had claimed for Canada that she would be the granary
and baker of the Empire, and Sir Edmund Barton had claimed for
Australia that she would be the Empire’s butcher; but in New Zealand
they had not all their eggs in one basket, and they could claim a
combination of the three.</p>
</div>

<p>This is quoted in a newspaper as an example of mixed metaphor. It is
nothing of the kind: <i>they</i> in New Zealand are detached from the
metaphor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We move slowly and cautiously from old moorings in our English life,
that is our laudable constitutional habit; but my belief is that the
great majority of moderate churchmen, to whatever political party they
may belong, desirous as they are to lift this question of popular
education out of the party rut, ....</p>
</div>

<p>‘A rut’, says the same newspaper, ‘is about the very last thing we
should expect to find at sea, despite the fact that it is ploughed’.
There is no mention of ruts at sea; the two metaphors are independent.
If the speaker had said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span> ‘Moderate churchmen, moving at length from
their old moorings, are beginning to lift this question out of the
party rut’, we should have had a genuine confusion, the <i>moorings</i>
and the <i>rut</i> being then inseparable. Both this sentence and the
preceding one, the reader may think, would have been better without
the second metaphor; we agree, but it is a question of taste, not of
correctness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... the keenest incentive man can feel to remedy ignorance and
abolish guilt. It is under the impelling force of this incentive that
civilization progresses.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This illustrates the danger of deciding hastily on the deadness of a
metaphor, however common it may be. Probably any one would have said
that the musical idea in <i>incentive</i> had entirely vanished: but
the successive attributes <i>keenness</i> and <i>impelling force</i>
are too severe a test; the dead metaphor is resuscitated, and a
perceptible confusion results.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Her forehand drive—her most trenchant asset.—<i>Daily Mail.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another case of resuscitation. <i>Trenchant</i> turns in its grave;
and <i>asset</i>, ready to succumb under the violence of athletic
reporters, has yet life enough to resent the imputation of a keen edge.
As the critic of ‘ruts at sea’ might have observed, the more blunt, the
better the assets.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And the very fact that the past is beyond recall imposes upon the
present generation a continual stimulus to strive for the prevention
of such woes.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We <i>impose</i> a burden, we apply a <i>stimulus</i>. It looks as if
the writer had meant by a short cut to give us both ideas; if so, his
guilt is clear; and if we call <i>impose</i> a mere slip in idiom, the
confusion is none the less apparent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sword of the devil, running with the blood of saints, poisoned adder,
thy work is done.</p>
</div>

<p>These are independent metaphors; and, as <i>thy work is done</i> is
applicable to each of them, there is no confusion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the hope that something might be done, even at the eleventh hour,
to stave off the brand of failure from the hide of our military
administration.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To <i>stave off a brand</i> is not, perhaps, impossible; but we
suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> that it would be a waste of energy. The idea of bulk is
inseparable from the process of staving off. The metaphor is usually
applied to literal abstract nouns, not to metaphorical concretes:
ruin and disaster one can suppose to be of a tolerable size; but a
metaphorical brand does not present itself to the imagination as
any larger than a literal one. We assume that by <i>brand</i> the
instrument is meant: the eleventh hour is all too early to set about
staving off the mark.</p>

<p>This is a good example of mixed metaphor of the more pronounced type;
it differs only in degree from some of those considered above. We
suggested that <i>impose a stimulus</i> was perhaps a short cut to
the expression of two different metaphors, and the same might be said
of <i>staving off the brand</i>. But we shall get a clearer idea of
the nature of mixed metaphor if we regard all these as violations
of the following simple rule: When a live metaphor (intentional or
unintentional) has once been chosen, the words grammatically connected
with it must be either (a) recognizable parts of the same metaphorical
idea, or one consistent with it, or (b) unmetaphorical, or dead
metaphor; literal abstract nouns, for instance, instead of metaphorical
concretes. Thus, we shall impose not the stimulus, but either (a) the
burden of resistance, or (b) the duty of resistance; and we shall stave
off not the ‘brand’ but the ‘ignominy of failure from our military
administration’.</p>

<p>But from our remarks in 4 above, it will be clear that (b), though it
cannot result in confusion of metaphor, may often leave the metaphor
unsustained. Our examples illustrate several common types.</p>

</div>

<p>The reader who is uncharitable enough to insist upon the natural
history of dilemmas will call this not unsustained metaphor, but a
gross confusion; horns cannot be said to <i>screw</i>. We prefer to
believe that De Quincey was not thinking of the horns at all; they
are a gratuitous metaphorical ornament; <i>dilemma</i>, in English
at any rate, is a literal word, and means an argument that presents
two undesirable alternatives. The circumstances of a dilemma are,
indeed, such as to prompt metaphorical language, but the word itself is
incorrigibly literal; we confess as much by clapping horns on its head
and making them do the metaphorical work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Repetition</span></h3>

<p>‘Rhetorical’ or—to use at once a wider and a more intelligible
term—‘significant’ repetition is a valuable element in modern style;
used with judgement, it is as truly a good thing as clumsy repetition,
the result of negligence, is bad. But there are some writers who, from
the fact that all good repetition is intentional, rashly infer that
all intentional repetition is good; and others who may be suspected of
making repetitions from negligence, and retaining them from a misty
idea that to be aware of a thing is to have intended it. Even when
the repetition is a part of the writer’s original plan, consideration
is necessary before it can be allowed to pass: it is implied in the
terms ‘rhetorical’ or significant repetition that the words repeated
would ordinarily be either varied or left out; the repetition, that
is to say, is more or less abnormal, and whatever is abnormal may be
objectionable in a single instance, and is likely to become so if it
occurs frequently.</p>

<p>The writers who have most need of repetition, and are most justified
in using it, are those whose chief business it is to appeal not to
the reader’s emotions, but to his understanding; for, in spite of
the term ‘rhetorical’, the object ordinarily is not impressiveness
for impressiveness’ sake, but emphasis for the sake of clearness. It
may seem, indeed, that a broad distinction ought to be drawn between
the rhetorical and the non-rhetorical: they differ in origin and in
aim, one being an ancient rhetorical device to secure impressiveness,
the other a modern development, called forth by the requirements of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
popular writers on subjects that demand lucidity; and there is the
further difference, that rhetorical repetition often dictates the whole
structure of the sentence, whereas the non-rhetorical, in its commonest
form, is merely the completion of a sentence that need not have been
completed. But in practice the two things become inseparable, and we
shall treat them together; only pointing out to the novice that of the
two motives, impressiveness and lucidity, the latter is far the more
likely to seem justifiable in the reader’s eyes.</p>

<p>We shall illustrate both the good and bad points of repetition almost
exclusively from a few pages of Bagehot, one of its most successful
exponents, in whom nevertheless it degenerates into mannerism. To a
writer who has so much to say that is worth hearing, almost anything
can be forgiven that makes for clearness; and in him clearness, vigour,
and a certain pleasant rapidity, all result from the free use of
repetition. It will be seen that his repetitions are not of the kind
properly called rhetorical; it is the spontaneous fullness of a writer
who, having a clear point to make, is determined to make it clearly,
elegance or no elegance. Yet the growth of mannerism is easily seen in
him; the justifiable repetitions are too frequent, and he has some that
do not seem justifiable.</p>

<p>He analysed not a particular government, but what is common to
all governments; not one law, but what is common to all laws; not
political communities in their features of diversity, but political
communities in their features of necessary resemblance. He gave
politics not an interesting aspect, but a new aspect: for by giving
men a steady view of what political communities must be, he nipped in
the bud many questions as to what they ought to be. As a gymnastic of
the intellect, and as a purifier, Mr. Austin’s philosophy is to this
day admirable—even in its imperfect remains; a young man who will
study it will find that he has gained something which he wanted, but
something which he did not know that he wanted: he has clarified a
part of his mind which he did not know needed clarifying.</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a writer who, at any rate, has not the vice of ‘elegant
variation’. Most of the possibilities of repetition, for good and
for evil, are here represented. As Bagehot himself might have said,
‘we have instances of repetition that are good in themselves; we
have instances of repetition that are bad in themselves; and we
have instances of repetition that are neither particularly good nor
particularly bad in themselves, but that offend simply by recurrence’.
The ludicrous appearance presented by our collection as a whole
necessarily obscures the merit of individual cases; but if the reader
will consider each sentence by itself, he will see that repetition
is often a distinct improvement. The point best illustrated here, no
doubt, is that it impossible to have too much of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span> a good thing; but it
is a good thing for all that. As instances of unjustifiable mannerism,
we may select ‘fit to be the favourites ..., and fit to be great
orators’; ‘not political communities ..., but political communities
...’; ‘something which he wanted, but something which he did not know
that he wanted’; ‘a man like Walpole, or a man like Louis Napoleon’;
‘without reluctance and without cessation’; ‘who did not like ...,
who did not like ...’; and ‘without Spanish and without French’. We
have mentioned clearness as the ultimate motive for repetition of this
kind: in this last sentence, we get not clearness, but obscurity.
Any one would suppose that there was some point in the distinction
between Spanish and French: there is none; the point is, simply, that
languages do not make a statesman. Again, there is sometimes virtue in
half-measures: from ‘something which he did not know that he wanted’
remove the first three words, and there remains quite repetition
enough. ‘Wild in life and not wild in mind’ is a repetition that is
clearly called for; but it is followed by the wholly gratuitous ‘fit
... and fit ...’, and the result is disastrous. Finally, in ‘who did
not like ..., who did not like ...’, mannerism gets the upper hand
altogether: instead of the appearance of natural vigour that ordinarily
characterizes the writer, we have stiff, lumbering artificiality.</p>

<p>Writers like Bagehot do not tend at all to impressive repetition:
their motive is always the business-like one of lucidity, though it is
sometimes lucidity run mad. Repetition of this kind, not being designed
to draw the reader’s attention to itself, wears much better in practice
than the more pronounced types of rhetorical repetition. The latter
should be used very sparingly. As the spontaneous expression of strong
feeling in the writer, it is sometimes justified by circumstances:
employed as a deliberate artifice to impress the reader, it is likely
to be frigid, and to fail in its object; and the term ‘rhetorical’
should remind us in either case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> that what may be spoken effectively
will not always bear the test of writing.</p>

<p>Rhetorical repetition, when it is clearly distinguishable from the
non-rhetorical, is too obvious to require much illustration. Of the
three instances given, the last is an excellent test case for the
principle that ‘whatever is intentional is good’.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous</span></h3>

<p>a. Some more trite phrases.</p>

<p>The worn-out phrases considered in a former section were of a humorous
tendency: we may add here some expressions of another kind, all of
them calculated in one way or another to save the writer trouble; the
trouble of description, or of producing statistics, or of thinking what
he means. Such phrases naturally die hard; even ‘more easily imagined
than described’ still survives the rough handling it has met with, and
flourishes in writers of a certain class. ‘Depend upon it’, ‘you may
take my word for it’, ‘in a vast majority of cases’, ‘no thinking man
will believe’, ‘all candid judges must surely agree’, ‘it would be a
slaying of the slain’, ‘I am old-fashioned enough to think’, are all
apt to damage the cause they advocate.</p>

<p>The shrill formula ‘It stands to reason’ is one of the worst offenders.
Originally harmless, and still no doubt often used in quite rational
contexts, the phrase has somehow got a bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span> name for prefacing
fallacies and for begging questions; it lacks the delicious candour of
its feminine equivalent—‘Kindly allow me to know best’—, but appeals
perhaps not less irresistibly to the generosity of an opponent. Apart
from this, there is a correct and an incorrect use of the words. It is
of course the conclusion drawn from certain premisses that stands to
reason; the premisses do not stand to reason; they are assumed to be
a matter of common knowledge, and ought to be distinguished from the
conclusion by <i>if</i> or a causal participle, not co-ordinated with
it by <i>and</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<i>b</i> squared. You may argue till we are both tired, you will never

mistakes.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that Russia, though vast, is a poor country,
that the war must cost immense sums, and that there must come a
time....—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Just as ‘stands to reason’ is not an argument, but an invitation to
believe, ‘the worthy Major’ not amusing, but an invitation to smile,
so the sentimental or sensational novelist has his special vocabulary
of the impressive, the tender, the tragic, and the horrible. One or
two of the more obvious catch-phrases may be quoted. In the ‘strong
man’ of fiction the reader may have observed a growing tendency to ‘sob
like a child’; the right-minded hero to whom temptation comes decides,
with archaic rectitude, that he ‘will not do <i>this thing</i>’; the
villain, taught by incessant ridicule to abstain from ‘muffled curses’,
finds a vent in ‘discordant laughs, that somehow jarred unpleasantly
upon my nerves’; this laugh, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> (‘cruel little
laugh, that somehow ...’), he shares with the heroine, who for her
exclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> perquisite has ‘this man who had somehow come into her
life’. <i>Somehow</i> and <i>half-dazed</i> are invaluable for throwing
a mysterious glamour over situations and characters that shun the broad
daylight of common sense.</p>

<p>b. Elementary irony.</p>

<p>A well-known novelist speaks of the resentment that children feel
against those elders who insist upon addressing them in a jocular tone,
as if serious conversation between the two were out of the question.
Irony is largely open to the same objection: the writer who uses it
is taking our intellectual measure; he forgets our <i>ex officio</i>
perfection in wisdom. Theoretically, indeed, the reader is admitted to
the author’s confidence; <i>he</i> is not the <i>corpus vile</i> on
which experiment is made: that, however, is scarcely more convincing
than the two-edged formula ‘present company excepted’. For minute,
detailed illustration of truths that have had the misfortune to become
commonplaces without making their due impression, sustained irony has
its legitimate use: tired of being told, and shown by direct methods,
that only the virtuous man is admirable, we are glad enough to go off
with Fielding on a brisk <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>: ‘for if not,
let some other kind of man be admirable; as Jonathan Wild’. But the
<i>reductio</i> process should be kept for emergencies, as Euclid kept
it, with whom it is a confession that direct methods are not available.
The isolated snatches of irony quoted below have no such justification:
they are for ornament, not for utility; and it is a kind of ornament
that is peculiarly un-English—a way of shrugging one’s shoulders in
print.</p>

writers of the present day affect the omission of <i>the</i> in all
cases where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> the superlative only means <i>very</i>. No harm will be
done if they eventually have their way: in the meantime, the omission

<p>d. Cheap originality.</p>

<p>Just as ‘elegant variation’ is generally a worse fault than monotony,
so the avoidance of trite phrases is sometimes worse than triteness
itself. Children have been known to satisfy an early thirst for
notoriety by merely turning their coats inside out; and ‘distinction’
of style has been secured by some writers on the still easier terms
of writing a common expression backwards. By this simplest of all
possible expedients, ‘wear and tear’ ceases to be English, and becomes
Carlylese, and Emerson acquires an exclusive property (so at least
one hopes) in ‘nothing or little’. The novice need scarcely be warned
against infringing these writers’ patents; it would be as unpardonable
as stealing the idea of a machine for converting clean knives into
dirty ones. Hackneyed phrases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> become hackneyed because they are
useful, in the first instance; but they derive a new efficiency from
the very fact that they are hackneyed. Their precise form grows to
be an essential part of the idea they convey, and all that a writer
effects by turning such a phrase backwards, or otherwise tampering
with it, is to give us our triteness at secondhand; we are put to the
trouble of translating ‘tear and wear’, only to arrive at our old
friend ‘wear and tear’, hackneyed as ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">PUNCTUATION</span></h2></div>


<p>In this chapter we shall adhere generally to our plan of not giving
systematic positive directions, or attempting to cover all ground
familiar and unfamiliar, important or not, but drawing attention only
to the most prevalent mistakes. On so technical a subject, however, a
few preliminary remarks may be made; and to those readers who would
prefer a systematic treatise Beadnell’s <i>Spelling and Punctuation</i>
(Wyman’s Technical Series, Menken, 2/6) may be recommended. We shall
refer to it occasionally in what follows; and the examples to which
—B. is attached instead of an author’s name are taken from it; these
are all given in Beadnell (unless the contrary is stated) as examples
of correct punctuation. It should be added that the book is written
rather from the compositor’s than from the author’s point of view, and
illustrates the compositor’s natural weaknesses; it is more important
to him, for instance, that a page should not be unsightly (the
unsightliness being quite imaginary, and the result of professional
conservatism) than that quotation marks and stops, or dashes and stops,
should be arranged in their true significant order; but, as the right
and unsightly is candidly given as well as the wrong and beautiful,
this does not matter; the student can take his choice.</p>

<p>We shall begin by explaining how it is that punctuation is a difficult
matter, and worth a writer’s serious attention. There are only six
stops, comma, semicolon, colon, full stop, question mark, exclamation
mark; or, with the dash, seven. The work of three of them, full stop,
question, exclamation, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span> so clear that mistakes about their use can
hardly occur without gross carelessness; and it might be thought that
with the four thus left it ought to be a very simple matter to exhaust
all possibilities in a brief code of rules. It is not so, however.
Apart from temporary disturbing causes—of which two now operative are
(1) the gradual disappearance of the colon in its old use with the
decay of formal periodic arrangement, and (2) the encroachments of the
dash as a saver of trouble and an exponent of emotion—there are also
permanent difficulties.</p>

<p>Before mentioning these we observe that the four stops in the strictest
acceptation of the word (,) (;) (:) (.)—for (!) and (?) are tones
rather than stops—form a series (it might be expressed also by 1, 2,
3, 4), each member of which directs us to pause for so many units of
time before proceeding. There is essentially nothing but a quantitative
time relation between them.</p>

<p>The first difficulty is that this single distinction has to convey to
the reader differences of more than one kind, and not commensurable; it
has to do both logical and rhetorical work. Its logical work is helping
to make clear the grammatical relations between parts of a sentence
or paragraph and the whole or other parts: its rhetorical work is
contributing to emphasis, heightening effect, and regulating pace. It
is in vain that Beadnell lays it down: ‘The variation of pause between
the words of the same thought is a matter of rhetoric and feeling, but
punctuation depends entirely upon the variation of relations—upon
logical and grammatical principles’. The difference between these two:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The master beat the scholar with a strap.—B.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The master beat the scholar, with a strap.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is in logic nothing; but in rhetoric it is the difference between
matter-of-fact statement and indignant statement: a strap, we are to
understand from the comma, is a barbarous instrument.</p>

<p>Again, in the two following examples, so far as logic goes, commas
would be used in both, or semicolons in both. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span> the writer of the
second desires to be slow, staccato, and impressive: the writer of the
first desires to be rapid and flowing, or rather, perhaps, does not
desire to be anything other than natural.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures, philosophers in
systems, logicians in subtilties, and metaphysicians in sounds.—B.</p>

<p>In the eclogue there must be nothing rude or vulgar; nothing fanciful
or affected; nothing subtle or abstruse.—B.</p>
</div>

<p>The difference is rhetorical, not logical. It is true, however, that
modern printers make an effort to be guided by logic or grammar alone;
it is impossible for them to succeed entirely; but any one who will
look at an Elizabethan book with the original stopping will see how far
they have moved: the old stopping was frankly to guide the voice in
reading aloud, while the modern is mainly to guide the mind in seeing
through the grammatical construction.</p>

<p>A perfect system of punctuation, then, that should be exact and
uniform, would require separate rhetorical and logical notations in
the first place. Such a system is not to be desired; the point is only
that, without it, usage must fluctuate according as one element is
allowed to interfere with the other. But a second difficulty remains,
even if we assume that rhetoric could be eliminated altogether. Our
stop series, as explained above, provides us with four degrees; but the
degrees of closeness and remoteness between the members of sentence
or paragraph are at the least ten times as many. It is easy to show
that the comma, even in its purely logical function, has not one, but
many tasks to do, which differ greatly in importance. Take the three
examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His method of handling the subject was ornate, learned, and
perspicuous.—B.</p>
</div>

<p>The removal of the comma after <i>learned</i> makes so little
difference that it is an open question among compositors whether it
should be used or not.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The criminal, who had betrayed his associates, was a prey to remorse.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>With the commas, the criminal is necessarily a certain person already
known to us: without them, we can only suppose a past state of society
to be described, in which all traitors were ashamed of themselves—a
difference of some importance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Colonel Hutchinson, the Governor whom the King had now appointed,
having hardened his heart, resolved on sterner measures.</p>
</div>

<p>Omission of the comma after <i>appointed</i> gives us two persons
instead of one, and entirely changes the meaning, making the central
words into, what they could not possibly be with the comma, an absolute
construction.</p>

<p>These commas, that is, have very different values; many intermediate
degrees might be added. Similarly the semicolon often separates
grammatically complete sentences, but often also the mere items of a
list, and between these extremes it marks other degrees of separation.
A perfect system for the merely logical part of punctuation, then,
would require some scores of stops instead of four. This again is not
a thing to be desired; how little, is clear from the fact that one of
our scanty supply, the colon, is now practically disused as a member
of the series, and turned on to useful work at certain odd jobs that
will be mentioned later. A series of stops that should really represent
all gradations might perhaps be worked by here and there a writer
consistently with himself; but to persuade all writers to observe the
same distinctions would be hopeless.</p>

<p>A third difficulty is this: not only must many tasks be performed by
one stop; the same task is necessarily performed by different stops
according to circumstances; as if polygamy were not bad enough, it
is complicated by an admixture of polyandry. We have already given
two sentences of nearly similar pattern, one of which had its parts
separated by commas, the other by semicolons, and we remarked that
the difference was there accounted for by the intrusion of rhetoric.
But the same thing occurs even when logic or grammar (it should be
explained that grammar is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> sometimes defined as logic applied to
speech, so that for our purposes the two are synonymous) is free from
the disturbing influence; or when that influence acts directly, not on
the stop itself that is in question, but only on one of its neighbours.
To illustrate the first case, when the stops are not affected by
rhetoric, but depend on grammar alone, we may take a short sentence
as a nucleus, elaborate it by successive additions, and observe how a
particular stop has to go on increasing its power, though it continues
to serve only the same purpose, because it must keep its predominance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for
individuals, is not the good man indignant?</p>
</div>

<p>The function of the comma is to mark the division between the
subordinate and the main clauses.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for
individuals, their playthings, to be demolished at their caprice; is
not the good man indignant?</p>
</div>

<p>The semicolon is doing now exactly what the comma did before; but, as
commas have intruded into the clause to do the humble yet necessary
work of marking two appositions, the original comma has to dignify its
relatively more important office by converting itself into a semicolon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When ambition asserts the monstrous doctrine of millions made for
individuals, their playthings, to be demolished at their caprice;
sporting wantonly with the rights, the peace, the comforts, the
existence, of nations, as if their intoxicated pride would, if
possible, make God’s earth their football: is not the good man
indignant?—B.</p>
</div>

<p>The new insertion is also an apposition, like the former ones; but,
as it contains commas within itself, it must be raised above their
level by being allowed a semicolon to part it from them. The previous
semicolon, still having the same supreme task to do, and challenged
by an upstart rival, has nothing for it but to change the regal for
the imperial crown, and become a colon. A careful observer will now
object that, on these principles, our new insertion ought to have
had an internal semicolon, to differentiate the subordinate clause,
<i>as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> if</i>, &amp;c., from the mere enumeration commas that precede: in
which case the semi-colon after <i>caprice</i> should be raised to a
colon; and then what is the newly created emperor to do? There is no
papal tiara for him to assume, the full stop being confined to the
independent sentence. The objection is quite just, and shows how soon
the powers of the four stops are exhausted if relentlessly worked.
But we are concerned only to notice that the effect of stops, even
logically considered, is relative, not absolute. It is also true that
many modern writers, if they put down a sentence like this, would be
satisfied with using commas throughout; the old-fashioned air of the
colon will hardly escape notice. But the whole arrangement is according
to the compositor’s art in its severer form.</p>

<p>A specimen of the merely indirect action of rhetoric may be more
shortly disposed of. In a sentence already quoted—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures, philosophers in
systems, logicians in subtilties, and metaphysicians in sounds—</p>
</div>

<p>suppose the writer to have preferred for impressive effect, as we said
he might have, to use semicolons instead of commas. The immediate
result of that would be that what before could be left to the reader
to do for himself (i. e., the supplying of the words <i>have sought
knowledge</i> in each member) will in presence of the semicolon require
to be done to the eye by commas, and the sentence will run:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures; philosophers, in
systems; logicians, in subtilties; and metaphysicians, in sounds.</p>
</div>

<p>But, lest we should be thought too faithful followers of the logicians,
we will now assume that our point has been sufficiently proved: the
difficulties of punctuation, owing to the interaction of different
purposes, and the inadequacy of the instruments, are formidable enough
to be worth grappling with.</p>

<p>We shall now only make three general remarks before proceeding to
details. The first is implied in what has been already said: the work
of punctuation is mainly to show, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> hint at, the grammatical relation
between words, phrases, clauses, and sentences; but it must not be
forgotten that stops also serve to regulate pace, to throw emphasis
on particular words and give them significance, and to indicate tone.
These effects are subordinate, and must not be allowed to conflict with
the main object; but as the grammatical relation may often be shown in
more than one way, that way can be chosen which serves another purpose
best.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is a sound principle that as few stops should be used as
will do the work. There is a theory that scientific or philosophic
matter should be punctuated very fully and exactly, whereas mere
literary work can do with a much looser system. This is a mistake,
except so far as scientific and philosophic writers may desire to give
an impressive effect by retarding the pace; that is legitimate; but
otherwise, all that is printed should have as many stops as help the
reader, and not more. A resolution to put in all the stops that can be
correctly used is very apt to result in the appearance of some that can
only be used incorrectly; some of our quotations from Huxley and Mr.
Balfour may be thought to illustrate this. And whereas slight stopping
may venture on small irregularities, full stopping that is incorrect
is also unpardonable. The objection to full stopping that is correct
is the discomfort inflicted upon readers, who are perpetually being
checked like a horse with a fidgety driver.</p>

<p>Thirdly, every one should make up his mind not to depend on his stops.
They are to be regarded as devices, not for saving him the trouble of
putting his words into the order that naturally gives the required
meaning, but for saving his reader the moment or two that would
sometimes, without them, be necessarily spent on reading the sentence
twice over, once to catch the general arrangement, and again for the
details. It may almost be said that what reads wrongly if the stops are
removed is radically bad; stops are not to alter meaning, but merely
to show it up. Those who are learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> to write should make a practice
of putting down all they want to say without stops first. What then,
on reading over, naturally arranges itself contrary to the intention
should be not punctuated, but altered; and the stops should be as few
as possible, consistently with the recognized rules. At this point
those rules should follow; but adequately explained and illustrated,
they would require a volume; and we can only speak of common abuses and
transgressions of them.</p>

<p>First comes what may be called for short the spot-plague—the tendency
to make full-stops do all the work. The comma, most important, if
slightest, of all stops, cannot indeed be got rid of, though even for
that the full-stop is substituted when possible; but the semicolon
is now as much avoided by many writers as the colon (in its old use)
by most. With the semicolon go most of the conjunctions. Now there
is something to be said for the change, or the two changes: the
old-fashioned period, or long complex sentence, carefully worked out
with a view to symmetry, balance, and degrees of subordination, though
it has a dignity of its own, is formal, stiff, and sometimes frigid;
the modern newspaper vice of long sentences either rambling or involved
(far commoner in newspapers than the spot-plague) is inexpressibly
wearisome and exasperating. Simplification is therefore desirable. But
journalists now and then, and writers with more literary ambition than
ability generally, overdo the thing till it becomes an affectation;
it is then little different from Victor Hugo’s device of making every
sentence a paragraph, and our last state is worse than our first.
Patronizing archness, sham ingenuousness, spasmodic interruption,
scrappy argument, dry monotony, are some of the resulting impressions.
We shall have to trouble the reader with at least one rather long
specimen; the spot-plague in its less virulent form, that is, when it
is caused not by pretentiousness or bad taste, but merely by desire
to escape from the period, does not declare itself very rapidly. What
follows is a third or so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> of a literary review, of which the whole is
in exactly the same style, and which might have been quoted entire
for the same purpose. It will be seen that it shows twenty full-stops
to one semicolon and no colons. Further, between no two of the twenty
sentences is there a conjunction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The life of Lord Chatham, which has just appeared in three volumes,
by Dr. Albert v. Ruville of the University of Halle deserves special
notice. It is much the most complete life which has yet appeared of
one of the most commanding figures in English history. It exhibits
that thoroughness of method which characterized German historical
writings of other days, and which has not lately been conspicuous.
It is learned without being dull, and is free from that uncritical
spirit of hostility to England which impairs the value of so many
recent German histories. That portion which deals with the closing
years of George II and with events following the accession of George
III is exceptionally interesting. One of the greatest misfortunes that
ever happened to England was the resignation of Pitt in 1761. It was
caused, as we all know, by difference of opinion with his colleagues
on the Spanish question. Ferdinand VI of Spain died in 1759, and was
succeeded by King Charles III, one of the most remarkable princes of
the House of Bourbon. This sovereign was an enthusiastic adherent of
the policy which found expression in the celebrated family compact.
On August 15, 1761, a secret convention was concluded between
France and Spain, under which Spain engaged to declare war against
England in May, 1762. Pitt quite understood the situation. He saw
that instant steps should be taken to meet the danger, and proposed
at a Cabinet held on October 2 that war should be declared against
Spain. Newcastle, Hardwicke, Anson, Bute, and Mansfield combated this
proposal, which was rejected, and two days afterwards Pitt resigned.
His scheme was neither immature nor ill-considered. He had made his
preparations to strike a heavy blow at the enemy, to seize the Isthmus
of Panama, thereby securing a port in the Pacific, and separating the
Spanish provinces of Mexico and Peru. He had planned an expedition
against Havana and the Philippine Islands, where no adequate
resistance could have been made; and, had he remained in office, there
is but little doubt that the most precious possessions of Spain in the
New World would have been incorporated in the British Empire. When he
left the Cabinet all virility seems to have gone out of it with him.
As he had foreseen, Spain declared war on England at a suitable moment
for herself, and the unfortunate negotiations were opened leading to
the Peace of Paris in 1763, which was pregnant with many disastrous
results for England. The circumstances which led to the resignation
of Pitt are dealt with by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span> Dr. v. Ruville much more lucidly than by
most historians. This portion of his work is the more interesting
because of the pains he takes to clear George III from the charge of
conspiring against his great Minister.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The reader’s experience has probably been that the constant fresh
starts are at first inspiriting, that about half-way he has had
quite enough of the novelty, and that he is intensely grateful, when
the solitary semicolon comes into sight, for a momentary lapse into
ordinary gentle progress. Writers like this may almost be suspected of
taking literally a summary piece of advice that we have lately seen in
a book on English composition: <i>Never use a semicolon when you can
employ a full-stop.</i> Beadnell lays down a law that at first sight
seems to amount to the same thing: <i>The notion of parting short
independent sentences otherwise than by a full-stop, rests upon no
rational foundation, and leads to endless perplexities.</i> But his
practice clears him of the imputation: he is saved by the ambiguity
of the word <i>independent</i>. There are grammatical dependence, and
dependence of thought. Of all those ‘little hard round unconnected
things’, in the <i>Times</i> review, that ‘seem to come upon one as
shot would descend from a shot-making tower’ (Sir Arthur Helps), hardly
one is not dependent on its neighbours in the more liberal sense,
though each is a complete sentence and independent in grammar. Now one
important use of stops is to express the degrees of thought dependence.
A style that groups several complete sentences together, by the use
of semicolons, because they are more closely connected in thought, is
far more restful and easy—for the reader, that is—than the style
that leaves him to do the grouping for himself; and yet it is free
from the formality of the period, which consists, not of grammatically
independent sentences, but of a main sentence with many subordinate
clauses. We have not space for a long example of the group system
rightly applied; most good modern writers free from the craving to be
up to date will supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> them on every page; but a very short quotation
may serve to emphasize the difference between group and spot-plague
principles. The essence of the latter is that almost the only stops
used are full-stops and commas, that conjunctions are rare, and that
when a conjunction does occur the comma is generally used, not the
full-stop. What naturally follows is an arrangement of this kind:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sheil of Ravensnuik was, for the present at least, at his
disposal. The foreman or ‘grieve’ at the Home Farm was anxious to be
friendly, but even if he lost that place, Dan Weir knew that there was
plenty of others.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(To save trouble, let it be stated that the sheil is a dependency
of the Home Farm, and not contrasted with or opposed to it.) Here
there are three grammatically independent sentences, between the two
latter of which the conjunction <i>but</i> is inserted. It follows
from spot-plague principles that there will be a full-stop at the end
of the first, and a comma at the end of the second. With the group
system it is not so simple a matter; before we can place the stops,
we have to inquire how the three sentences are connected in thought.
It then appears that the friendliness of the grieve is mentioned to
account for the sheil’s being at disposal; that is, there is a close
connexion, though no conjunction, between the first and the second
sentences. Further, the birds in the bush of the third sentence are
contrasted, not with the second sentence’s friendliness, but with the
first sentence’s bird in the hand (which, however, is accounted for by
the second sentence’s friendliness). To group rightly, then, we must
take care, quite reversing the author’s punctuation, that the first and
second are separated by a stop of less power than that which separates
the third from them. Comma, semicolon, would do it, if the former were
sufficient between two grammatically independent sentences not joined
by a conjunction; it obviously is not sufficient here (though in some
such pairs it might be); so, instead of comma, semicolon, we must use
semicolon, full-stop;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> and the sentence will run, with its true meaning
much more clearly given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sheil of Ravensnuik was, for the present at least, at his
disposal; the foreman or ‘grieve’ at the Home Farm was anxious to be
friendly. But even if he lost that place, Dan Weir knew that there was
plenty of others.</p>
</div>

<p>The group system gives more trouble to the writer or compositor, and
less to the reader; the compositor cannot be expected to like it, if
the burden falls on him; inferior writers cannot be expected to choose
it either, perhaps; but the good writers who do choose it no doubt find
that after a short time the work comes to do itself by instinct.</p>

<p>We need now only add two or three short specimens, worse, though from
their shortness less remarkable, than the <i>Times</i> extract. They
are not specially selected as bad; but it may be hoped that by their
juxtaposition they may have some deterrent effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So Dan opened the door a little and the dog came out as if nothing had

<p>Allies must have common sentiments, a common policy, common interests.
Russia’s disposition is aggressive. Her policy is the closed door.
Her interests lie in monopoly. With our country it is precisely the
opposite. Japan may conquer, but she will not aggress. Russia may be
defeated, but she will not abandon her aggression. With such a country
an alliance is beyond the conception even of a dream.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Upon a hillside, a great swelling hillside, high up near the clouds,
lay a herd lad. Little more than a boy he was. He did not know much,
but he wanted to know more. He was not very good, but he wanted to be
better. He was lonely, but of that he was not aware. On the whole he
was content up there on his great hillside.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>

<p>To be popular you have to be interested, or appear to be
interested, in other people. And there are so many in this world
in whom it is impossible to be interested. So many for whom the
most skilful hypocrisy cannot help us to maintain a semblance of
interest.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>Of course a girl so pretty as my Miss Anne could not escape having
many suitors, especially as all over the countryside Sir Tempest had
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> name of being something of a skinflint. And skinflints are always
rich, as is well known.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The last sentence here is a mere comment on what is itself only an
appendage, the clause introduced by <i>especially</i>; it has therefore
no right to the dignity of a separate sentence. But it can hardly be
mended without some alteration of words as well as stops; for instance,
put a semicolon after suitors, write <i>moreover</i> for <i>especially
as</i>, and put only a comma after <i>skinflint</i>; the right
proportion would then be secured.</p>

<p>The spot-plague, as we have shown, sometimes results in illogicality;
it need not do so, however; when it does, the fault lies with the
person who, accepting its principles, does not arrange his sentences
to suit them. It is a new-fashioned and, in our opinion, unpleasant
system, but quite compatible with correctness.</p>

<p>Over-stopping, to which we now proceed, is on the contrary
old-fashioned; but it is equally compatible with correctness. Though
old-fashioned, it still lingers obstinately enough to make some slight
protest desirable; the superstition that every possible stop should be
inserted in scientific and other such writing misleads compositors,
and their example affects literary authors who have not much ear. Any
one who finds himself putting down several commas close to one another
should reflect that he is making himself disagreeable, and question his
conscience, as severely as we ought to do about disagreeable conduct in
real life, whether it is necessary. He will find that the parenthetic
or emphatic effect given to an adverbial phrase by putting a comma
at each end of it is often of no value whatever to his meaning; in
other words, that he can make himself agreeable by merely putting off
a certain pompous solemnity; erasing a pair of commas may make the
difference in writing that is made in conversation by a change of tone
from the didactic to the courteous. Sometimes the abundance of commas
is not so easily reduced; a change in the order of words, the omission
of a needless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span> adverb or conjunction, even the recasting of a sentence,
may be necessary. But it is a safe statement that a gathering of commas
(except on certain lawful occasions, as in a list) is a suspicious
circumstance. The sentence should at least be read aloud, and if it
halts or jolts some change or other should be made.</p>

<p>A good example of the warning value of commas. None of these can
be dispensed with, since there are no less than three parenthetic
qualifications to the sentence. But the crowd of commas ought to have
told the writer how bad his sentence was; it is like an obstacle race.
It should begin, It is true that ..., which disposes of one obstacle.

<p>Putting commas round <i>apparently</i> amounts to the insertion of a
further clause, such as, Though you would not think they could be such
fools. But what the precise contents of the further clause may be is
problematic. At any rate, a writer should not invite us to read between
the lines unless he is sure of two things: what he wants to be read
there; and that we are likely to be willing and able readers of it. The
same is true of many words that are half adverbs and half conjunctions,
like <i>therefore</i>. We have the right to comma them off if we like;
but, unless it is done with a definite purpose, it produces perplexity
as well as heaviness. In the first of the next two examples, there is
no need whatever for the commas. In the second, the motive is clear:
having the choice between commas and no commas, the reporter uses them
because he so secures a pause after <i>he</i>, and gives the word that
emphasis which in the speech as delivered doubtless made the <i>I</i>
that it represents equivalent to <i>I for my part</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>After <i>for</i> and <i>and</i> beginning a sentence commas are often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
used that are hardly even correct. It may be suspected that writers
allow themselves to be deceived by the false analogy of sentences
in which the <i>and</i> or <i>for</i> is immediately followed by a
subordinate clause or phrase that has a right to its two commas. When
there is no such interruption, the only possible plea for the comma is
that it is not logical but rhetorical, and conveys some archness or
other special significance such as is hardly to be found in our two
examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And, it is true that these were the days of mental and moral
fermentation.—<span class="smcap">Hutton.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We shall class here also, assuming for the present that the rhetorical
plea may be allowed even when there is no logical justification for a
stop, two sentences in which the copula <i>is</i>, standing between
subject and complement, has commas on each side of it. Impressiveness
is what is aimed at; it seems to us a tawdry device for giving one’s
sentence an <i>ex cathedra</i> air:</p>

<p>Many other kinds of over-stopping might be illustrated; but we have
intentionally confined ourselves here to specimens in which grammatical
considerations do not arise, and the sentence is equally correct
whether the stops are inserted or not. Sentences in which over-stopping
outrages grammar more or less decidedly will be incidentally treated
later on. Meanwhile we make the general remark that ungrammatical
insertion of stops is a high crime and misdemeanour, whereas
ungrammatical omission of them is often venial, and in some cases
even desirable. Nevertheless the over-stopping that offends against
nothing but taste has its counterpart in under-stopping of the same
sort. And it must be added that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> nothing so easily exposes a writer
to the suspicion of being uneducated as omission of commas against
nearly universal custom. In the examples that follow, every one will
see at the first glance where commas are wanting. When it is remembered
that, as we have implied, an author has the right to select the degree
of intensity, or scale, of his punctuation, it can hardly be said
that grammar actually demands any stops in these sentences taken by
themselves. Yet the effect, unless we choose to assume misprints, as we
naturally do in isolated cases, is horrible.</p>

</div>

<p>Although we are, when we turn from taste to grammar, on slightly firmer
ground, it will be seen that there are many debatable questions; and
we shall have to use some technical terms. As usual, only those points
will be attended to which our observation has shown to be important.</p>

<p>1. The substantival clause.</p>

<p>Subordinate clauses are sentences containing a subject and predicate,
but serving the purpose in the main sentence (to which they are
sometimes joined by a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun,
but sometimes without any separate and visible link) of single words,
namely, of noun, adjective, or adverb; they are called respectively
substantival, adjectival, or adverbial clauses. Examples:</p>

<p>Substantival. He asked <i>what I should do</i>. (<i>my plan</i>, noun)</p>

<p>Adjectival. The man <i>who acts honestly</i> is respected.
(<i>honest</i>, adjective)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Adverbial. I shall see you <i>when the sun next rises</i>.
(<i>to-morrow</i>, adverb)</p>

<p>Now there is no rule that subordinate clauses must be separated from
the main sentence by a stop; that depends on whether they are essential
parts of the proposition (when stops are generally wrong), or more or
less separable accidents (when commas are more or less required). But
what we wish to draw attention to is a distinction in this respect,
very generally disregarded, between the substantival clause and the
two other kinds. When the others are omitted, though the desired
meaning may be spoilt, the grammar generally remains uninjured; a
complete, though not perhaps valuable sentence is left. <i>The man is
respected</i>, <i>I shall see you</i>, are as much sentences alone as
they were with the adjectival and adverbial clauses. With substantival
clauses this is seldom true; they are usually the subjects, objects,
or complements, of the verbs, that is, are grammatically essential.
<i>He asked</i> is meaningless by itself. (Even if the point is that he
asked and did not answer, <i>things</i>, or <i>something</i>, has to be
supplied in thought.) Now it is a principle, not without exceptions,
but generally sound, that the subject, object, or complement, is not
to be separated from its verb even by a comma (though <i>two</i>
commas belonging to an inserted parenthetic clause or phrase or word
may intervene). It follows that there is no logical or grammatical
justification, though there may be a rhetorical one, for the comma so
frequently placed before the <i>that</i> of an indirect statement.
Our own opinion (which is, however, contrary to the practice of
most compositors) is that this should always be omitted except when
the writer has a very distinct reason for producing rhetorical
impressiveness by an unusual pause. Some very ugly overstopping would
thus be avoided.</p>

<p>The general opinion however was, that, if Bute had been early
practised in debate, he might have become an impressive
speaker.—<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The comma before <i>whether</i> in the next is actually misleading; we
are tempted to take as adverbial what is really a substantival clause,
object to the verbal noun <i>indifference</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The book ... had merits due to the author’s indifference, whether he
showed bad taste or not, provided he got nearer to the impression he
wished to convey.—<i>Speaker.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Grammar, however, would afford some justification for distinguishing
between the substantival clause as subject, object, or complement, and
the substantival clause in apposition with one of these. Though there
should decidedly be no comma in <i>He said that ...</i>, it is strictly
defensible in <i>It is said, that....</i> The <i>that</i>-clause in
the latter is explanatory of, and in apposition with, <i>it</i>; and
the ordinary sign of apposition is a comma. Similarly, <i>My opinion
is that</i>: <i>It is my opinion, that</i>. But as there seems to be
no value whatever in the distinction, our advice is to do without the
comma in all ordinary cases of either kind. A useful and reasonable
exception is made in some manuals; for instance, in Bigelow’s <i>Manual
of Punctuation</i> we read: ‘Clauses like “It is said”, introducing
several propositions or quotations, each preceded by the word
<i>that</i>, should have a comma before the first <i>that</i>. But if a
single proposition or quotation only is given, no comma is necessary.
Example:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Philosophers assert, that Nature is unlimited in her operations, that
she has inexhaustible treasures in reserve, that....’</p>
</div>

<p>Anything that shows the reader what he is to expect, and so saves
him the trouble of coming back to revise his first impressions, is
desirable if there is no strong reason against it.</p>

<p>A more important distinction is this: <i>He said</i>, &amp;c., may have
for its object, and <i>It is said</i>, &amp;c., for its (virtual) subject,
either the actual words said, or a slight rearrangement of them (not
necessarily to the eye, but at least to the mind), which makes them
more clearly part of the grammatical construction, and turns them into
true subordinate clauses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span> Thus <i>He told her, You are in danger</i>
may be kept, but is usually altered to <i>He told her that she was in
danger</i>, or to <i>He told her she was in danger</i>. In the first,
<i>You are in danger</i> is not properly a subordinate clause, but a
sentence, which may be said to be in apposition with <i>these words</i>
understood. In the second and third alike, the altered words are a
subordinate substantival clause, the object to <i>told</i>. It follows
that when the actual words are given as such (this is sometimes only
to be known by the tone: compare <i>I tell you, I will come</i>, and
<i>I tell you I will come</i>), a comma should be inserted; whereas,
when they are meant as mere reported or indirect speech, it should be
omitted. Actual words given as such should also be begun with a capital
letter; and if they consist of a compound sentence, or of several
sentences, a comma will not suffice for their introduction; a colon,
a colon and dash, or a full stop, with quotation marks always in the
last case, and usually in the others, will be necessary; but these are
distinctions that need not be considered here in detail.</p>

<p>Further, it must be remembered that substantival clauses include
indirect questions as well as indirect statements, and that the same
rules will apply to them. The two following examples are very badly
stopped:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Add to all this that he died in his thirty-seventh
year: and then ask, If it be strange that his poems are
imperfect?—<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Accommodation of the stops to the words would give:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>and then ask if it be strange that his poems are imperfect.</p>
</div>

<p>And accommodation of the words to the stops would give:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>and then ask, Is it strange that his poems are imperfect?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It may be asked can further depreciation be
afforded.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The two correct alternatives here are similarly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It may be asked, Can further depreciation be afforded?</p>

<p>It may be asked whether further depreciation can be afforded.</p>
</div>

<p>As the sentences stood originally, we get in the Carlyle a most
theatrical, and in the <i>Times</i> a most slovenly effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>2. The verb and its subject, object, or complement.</p>

<p>Our argument against the common practice of placing a comma before
substantival <i>that</i>-clauses and others like them was, in brief:
This sort of <i>that</i>-clause is simply equivalent to a noun; that
noun is, with few exceptions, the subject, object, or complement, to a
verb; and between things so closely and essentially connected as the
verb and any of these no stop should intervene (unless for very strong
and special rhetorical reasons). This last principle, that the verb and
its essential belongings must not be parted, was merely assumed. We
think it will be granted by any one who reads the next two examples.
It is felt at once that a writer who will break the principle with so
little excuse as here will shrink from nothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So poor Byron was dethroned, as I had prophesied he would be,
though I had little idea that his humiliation, would be brought
about by one, whose sole strength consists in setting people to
sleep.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>

<p>He was, moreover, not an unkind man; but the crew of the
<i>Bounty</i>, mutinied against him, and set him half naked in an open
boat.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Very little better than these, but each with some perceptible motive,
are the next six:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Depreciation of him, fetched up at a stroke the glittering armies of
her enthusiasm.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>

<p>Opposition to him, was comparable to the stand of blocks of timber
before a flame.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In each of these the comma acts as an accent upon <i>him</i>, and is
purely rhetorical and illogical.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such women as you, are seldom troubled with remorse.—<span class="smcap">Corelli.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Here the comma guards us from taking <i>you are</i> together. We have
already said that this device is illegitimate. Such sentences should be
recast; for instance, Women like you are seldom, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The thick foliage of the branching oaks and elms in my grounds
afforded grateful shade and repose to the tired body, while the
tranquil loveliness of the woodland and meadow scenery, comforted and
soothed the equally tired mind.—<span class="smcap">Corelli.</span></p>

<p>With them came young boys and little children, while on either side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>

silver censers to and fro.—<span class="smcap">Corelli.</span></p>

<p>Swift’s view of human nature, is too black to admit of any hopes of
their millennium.—<span class="smcap">L. Stephen.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Loveliness</i>, <i>maidens</i>, <i>view</i>, the strict subjects,
have adjectival phrases attached after them. The temptation to insert
the comma is comprehensible, but slight, and should have been resisted.</p>

<p>In the three that come next, the considerable length of the subject,
it must be admitted, makes a comma comforting; it gives us a sort of
assurance that we have kept our hold on the sentence. It is illogical,
however, and, owing to the importance of not dividing subject from
verb, unpleasantly illogical. In each case the comfort would be
equally effective if it were legitimized by the insertion of a comma
before as well as after the clause or phrase at the end of which the
present comma stands. The extra commas would be after <i>earth</i>,
<i>victims</i>, <i>Schleiden</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>It may be said that it is ‘fudging’ to find an excuse, as we have
proposed to do, for a stop that we mean really to do something
different from its ostensible work. But the answer is that with few
tools and many tasks to do much fudging is in fact necessary.</p>

<p>A special form of this, in protest against which we shall give five
examples, each from a different well-known author, is when the subject
includes and ends with a defining relative clause, after which an
illogical comma is placed. As the relative clause is of the defining
kind (a phrase that has been explained<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>), it is practically
impossible to fudge in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> sentences by putting a comma before the
relative pronoun. Even in the first sentence the length of the relative
clause is no sufficient excuse; and in all the others we should abolish
the comma without hesitation.</p>

<p>In the two sentences that now follow from Mr. Morley, the offending
comma of the first parts <i>centre</i>, which is what grammarians call
the oblique complement, from its verb <i>made</i>; the offending comma
of the second parts the direct object <i>groups</i> from its verb
<i>drew</i>. Every one will allow that the sentences are clumsy; most
people will allow that the commas are illogical. As for us, we do not
say that, if the words are to be kept as they are, the commas should
be omitted; but we do say that a good writer, when he found himself
reduced to illogical commas, should have taken the trouble to rearrange
his words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

an individual Frenchman.—<span class="smcap">Morley.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It may be added, by way of concluding this section, that the insertion
of a comma in the middle of an absolute construction, which is capable,
as was shown in the sentence about Colonel Hutchinson and the governor,
of having very bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span> results indeed, is only a particular instance and
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of inserting a comma between subject and
verb. The comma in the absolute construction is so recognized a trap
that it might have been thought needless to mention it; the following
instances, however, will show that a warning is even now necessary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir E. Seymour, having replied for the Navy, the Duke of Connaught, in
replying for the Army, said....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Thus <i>got</i>, having been by custom poorly substituted for

<p>But that didn’t last long; for Dr. Blimber, happening to change the
position of his tight plump legs, as if he were going to get up, Toots
swiftly vanished.—<span class="smcap">Dickens.</span></p>
</div>

<p>3. The adjectival clause.</p>

<p>This, strictly speaking, does the work of an adjective in the
sentence. It usually begins with a relative pronoun, but sometimes
with a relative adverb. The man <i>who does not breathe</i> dies, is
equivalent to The <i>unbreathing</i> man dies. The place <i>where we
stand</i> is holy ground, is equivalent to <i>This</i> place is holy
ground. But we shall include under the phrase all clauses that begin
with a relative, though some relative clauses are not adjectival,
because a division of all into defining clauses on the one hand, and
non-defining or commenting on the other, is more easily intelligible
than the division into adjectival and non-adjectival. This distinction
is more fully gone into in the chapter on Syntax, where it is suggested
that <i>that</i>, when possible, is the appropriate relative for
defining, and <i>which</i> for non-defining clauses. That, however, is
a debatable point, and quite apart from the question of stopping that
arises here. Examples of the two types are:</p>

<p>(Defining) The river that (which) runs through London is turbid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>(Commenting) The Thames, which runs through London, is turbid.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the first the relative clause is an answer to
the imaginary question, ‘Which river?’; that is, it defines the noun
to which it belongs. In the second, such a question as ‘Which Thames?’
is hardly conceivable; the relative clause gives us a piece of extra
and non-essential information, an independent comment. The two types
are not always so easily distinguished as in these examples constructed
for the purpose. What we wish here to say is that it would contribute
much to clearness of style if writers would always make up their minds
whether they intend a definition or a comment, and would invariably use
no commas with a defining clause, and two commas with a non-defining.
All the examples that follow are in our opinion wrong. The first three
are of defining relative clauses wrongly preceded by commas; the
second three of commenting relative clauses wrongly not preceded by
commas. The last of all there may be a doubt about. If the long clause
beginning with <i>which</i> is intended merely to show how great the
weariness is, and <i>which</i> is practically equivalent to <i>so great
that</i>, it may be called a defining clause, and the omission of the
comma is right. But if the <i>which</i> really acts as a mere connexion
to introduce a new fact that the correspondent wishes to record, the
clause is non-defining, and the comma ought according to our rule to be
inserted before it.</p>

without being practically inconvenient.—<span class="smcap">Balfour.</span></p>

</div>

<p>4. The adverb, adverbial phrase, and adverbial clause.</p>

<p>In writing of substantival and adjectival clauses, our appeal was for
more logical precision than is usual. We said that the comma habitual
before substantival clauses was in most cases unjustifiable, and should
be omitted even at the cost of occasional slight discomfort. We said
that with one division of adjectival, or rather relative clauses,
commas should always be used, and with another they should always be
omitted. With the adverbial clauses, phrases, and words, on the other
hand, our appeal is on the whole for less precision; we recommend that
less precision should be aimed at, at least, though more attained, than
at present. Certain kinds of laxity here are not merely venial, but
laudable: certain other kinds are damning evidence of carelessness or
bad taste or bad education. It is not here a mere matter of choosing
between one right and one wrong way; there are many degrees.</p>

<p><i>Now</i> is an adverb; <i>in the house</i> is usually an adverbial
phrase; <i>if I know it</i> is an adverbial clause. Logic and grammar
never prohibit the separating of any such expressions from the rest of
their sentence—by two commas if they stand in the middle of it, by
one if they begin or end it. But use of the commas tends, especially
with a single word, but also with a phrase or clause, though in inverse
proportion to its length, to modify the meaning. <i>I cannot do it
now</i> means no more than it says: <i>I cannot do it, now</i> conveys
a further assurance that the speaker would have been delighted to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
it yesterday or will be quite willing tomorrow. This distinction,
generally recognized with the single word, applies also to clauses; and
writers of judgement should take the fullest freedom in such matters,
allowing no superstition about ‘subordinate clauses’ to force upon them
commas that they feel to be needless, but inclining always when in
doubt to spare readers the jerkiness of overstopping. It is a question
for rhetoric alone, not for logic, so long as the proper allowance
of commas, if any, is given; what the proper allowance is, has been
explained a few lines back. We need not waste time on exemplifying this
simple principle; there is so far no real laxity; the writer is simply
free.</p>

<p>Laxity comes in when we choose, guided by nothing more authoritative
than euphony, to stop an adverbial phrase or adverbial clause, but
not to stop it at both ends, though it stands in the middle of its
sentence. This is an unmistakable offence against logic, and lays one
open to the condemnation of examiners and precisians. But the point we
wish to make is that in a very large class of sentences the injury to
meaning is so infinitesimal, and the benefit to sound so considerable,
that we do well to offend. The class is so large that only one example
need be given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But with their triumph over the revolt, Cranmer and his colleagues
advanced yet more boldly.—<span class="smcap">J. R. Green.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The adverbial phrase is <i>with their triumph over the revolt</i>.
<i>But</i> does not belong to it, but to the whole sentence. The writer
has no defence whatever as against the logician; nevertheless, his
reader will be grateful to him. The familiar intrusion of a comma after
initial <i>And</i> and <i>For</i> where there is no intervening clause
to justify it, of which we gave examples when we spoke of overstopping,
comes probably by false analogy from the unpleasant pause that rigid
punctuation has made common in sentences of this type.</p>

<p>Laxity once introduced, however, has to be carefully kept within
bounds. It may be first laid down absolutely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> when an adverbial
clause is to be stopped, but incompletely stopped, the omitted stop
must always be the one at the beginning, and never the one at the end.
Transgression of this is quite intolerable; we shall give several
instances at the end of the section to impress the fact. But it is also
true that even the omission of the beginning comma looks more and more
slovenly the further we get from the type of our above cited sentence.
The quotations immediately following are arranged from the less to the
more slovenly.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the sentence from Mr. Balfour the chief
objection to omitting the comma between <i>and</i> and <i>without</i>
is that we are taken off on a false scent, it being natural at first to
suppose that we are to supply <i>was</i> again; this can only happen
when we are in the middle of a sentence, and not at the beginning as in
the pattern Cranmer sentence.</p>

<p>The gross negligence or ignorance betrayed by giving the first and
omitting the second comma will be convincingly shown by this array of
sentences from authors of all degrees.</p>

<p>5. Parenthesis.</p>

<p>In one sense, everything that is adverbial is parenthetic: it can be
inserted or removed, that is, without damaging the grammar, though not
always without damaging the meaning, of the sentence. But the adverbial
parenthesis, when once inserted, forms a part of the sentence; we have
sufficiently dealt with the stops it requires in the last section; the
use of commas emphasizes its parenthetic character, and is therefore
sometimes desirable, sometimes not; no more need be said about it.</p>

<p>Another kind of parenthesis is that whose meaning practically governs
the sentence in the middle of which it is nevertheless inserted as an
alien element that does not coalesce in grammar with the rest. The
type is—But, you will say, Caesar is not an aristocrat. This kind is
important for our purpose because of the muddles often made, chiefly by
careless punctuation, between the real parenthesis and words that give
the same meaning, but are not, like it, grammatically separable. We
shall start with an indisputable example of this muddle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Where, do you imagine, she would lay it?—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>These commas cannot possibly indicate anything but parenthesis; but, if
the comma’d words were really a parenthesis, we ought to have <i>would
she</i> instead of <i>she would</i>. The four sentences that now follow
are all of one pattern. The bad stopping is probably due to this same
confusion between the parenthetic and the non-parenthetic. But it
is possible that in each the two commas are independent, the first
being one of those that are half rhetorical and half caused by false
analogy, which have been mentioned as common after initial <i>And</i>
and <i>For</i>; and the second being the comma wrongly used, as we have
maintained, before substantival <i>that</i>-clauses.</p>

</div>

<p>A less familiar form of this mistake, and one not likely to occur
except in good writers, since inferior ones seldom attempt the
construction that leads to it, is sometimes found when a subordinating
conjunction is placed late in its clause, after the object or
other member. In the Thackeray sentence, it will be observed that
the first comma would be right (1) if <i>them</i> had stood after
<i>discovered</i> instead of where it does, (2) if <i>them</i> had been
omitted, and <i>any</i> had served as the common object to both verbs.</p>

</div>

<p>6. The misplaced comma.</p>

<p>Some authors would seem to have an occasional feeling that here or
hereabouts is the place for a comma, just as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> handwriting some
persons are well content if they get a dot in somewhere within
measurable distance of its <i>i</i>. The dot is generally over the
right word at any rate, and the comma is seldom more than one word off
its true place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All true science begins with empiricism—though all true science is

<p><i>For the most part</i>, alone, is the adverbial parenthesis.</p>

<p>But this fault occurs, perhaps nine times out of ten, in combination
with the <i>that</i>-clause comma so often mentioned. It may be said,
when our instances have been looked into, that in each of them,
apart from the <i>that</i>-clause comma, which is recognized by many
authorities, there is merely the licence that we have ourselves
allowed, omission of the first, without omission of the last, comma of
an adverbial parenthesis. But we must point out that Huxley, Green, and
Mr. Balfour, man of science, historian, and philosopher, all belong
to that dignified class of writers which is supposed to, and in most
respects does, insist on full logical stopping; they, in view of their
general practice, are not entitled to our slovenly and merely literary
licences.</p>

<p>7. Enumeration.</p>

<p>This name, liberally interpreted, is meant to include several more
or less distinct questions. They are difficult, and much debated by
authorities on punctuation, but are of no great importance. We shall
take the liberty of partly leaving them undecided, and partly giving
arbitrary opinions; to argue them out would take more space than it is
worth while to give. But it <i>is</i> worth while to draw attention to
them, so that each writer may be aware that they exist, and at least be
consistent with himself. Typical sentences (from Beadnell) are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> Industry, honesty, and temperance, are essential to
happiness.—B.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Let us freely drink in the soul of love and beauty and
wisdom, from all nature and art and history.—B.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Plain honest truth wants no colouring.—B.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Many states are in alliance with, and under the protection
of France.—B.</p>
</div>

<p>Common variants for (<i>a</i>) are (1) Industry, honesty and temperance
are essential ... (2) Industry, honesty and temperance, are essential
... (3) Industry, honesty, and temperance are essential.... We
unhesitatingly recommend the original and fully stopped form, which
should be used irrespective of style, and not be interfered with by
rhetorical considerations; it is the only one to which there is never
any objection. Of the examples that follow, the first conforms to the
correct type, but no serious harm would be done if it did not. The
second also conforms; and, if this had followed variant (1) or (2),
here indistinguishable, we should have been in danger of supposing that
Education and Police were one department instead of two. The third,
having no comma after <i>interests</i>, follows variant (3), and, as
it happens, with no bad effect on the meaning. All three variants,
however, may under different conditions produce ambiguity or worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But those that remain, the women, the youths, the children, and the
elders, work all the harder.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Japanese advisers are now attached to the departments of the
Household, War, Finance, Education, and Police.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>An American, whose patience, tact, and ability in
reconciling conflicting interests have won the praise of all
nationalities.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes enumerations are arranged in pairs; it is then most
unpleasant to have the comma after the last pair omitted, as in:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The orange and the lemon, the olive and the walnut elbow each other
for a footing in the fat dark earth.—<span class="smcap">F. M. Crawford.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There is a bastard form of enumeration against which warning is
seriously needed. It is viewed as, but is not really, a legitimate case
of type (<i>a</i>); and a quite unnecessary objection to the repetition
of <i>and</i> no doubt supplies the motive. Examples are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He kept manœuvring upon Neipperg, who counter-manœuvred
with vigilance, good judgment, and would not come to
action.—<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>

<p>Moltke had recruited, trained, and knew by heart all the men under
him.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Hence loss of time, of money, and sore trial of patience.—<span class="smcap">R. G.
White.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The principle is this: in an enumeration given by means of a comma
or commas, the last comma being replaced by or combined with
<i>and</i>—our type (<i>a</i>), that is—, there must not be anything
that is common to two members (as here, <i>counter-manœuvred with</i>,
<i>had</i>, <i>loss</i>) without being common to all. We may say,
Moltke had recruited and trained and knew, Moltke had recruited, had
trained, and knew, or, Moltke had recruited, trained, and known; but we
must not say what the <i>Times</i> says. The third sentence may run,
Loss of time and money, and sore trial, or, Loss of time, of money, and
of patience; but not as it does.</p>

<p>So much for type (<i>a</i>). Type (<i>b</i>) can be very shortly
disposed of. It differs in that the conjunction (<i>and</i>,
<i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>, &amp;c.) is expressed every time, instead of being
represented except in the last place by a comma. It is logically
quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> unnecessary, but rhetorically quite allowable, to use commas
as well as conjunctions. The only caution needed is that, if commas
are used at all, and if the enumeration does not end the sentence, and
is not concluded by a stronger stop, a comma must be inserted after
the last member as well as after the others. In the type sentence,
which contains two enumerations, it would be legitimate to use commas
as well as <i>and</i>s with one set and not with the other, if it
were desired either to avoid monotony or to give one list special
emphasis. The three examples now to be added transgress the rule about
the final comma. We arrange them from bad to worse; in the last of
them, the apparently needless though not necessarily wrong comma after
<i>fall</i> suggests that the writer has really felt a comma to be
wanting to the enumeration, but has taken a bad shot with it, as in the
examples of section 6 on the misplaced comma.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Neither the Court, nor society, nor Parliament, nor the older
men in the Army have yet recognized the fundamental truth
that....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>A subordinate whose past conduct in the post he fills, and whose known
political sympathies make him wholly unfitted, however loyal his
intentions may be, to give that....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>But there are uninstructed ears on whom the constant abuse, and
imputation of low motives may fall, with a mischievous and misleading
effect.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of type (<i>c</i>) the characteristic is that we have two or more
adjectives attached to a following noun; are there to be commas between
the adjectives, or not? The rule usually given is that there should be,
unless the last adjective is more intimately connected with the noun,
so that the earlier one qualifies, not the noun, but the last adjective
and the noun together; it will be noticed that we strictly have no
enumeration then at all. This is sometimes useful; and so is the more
practical and less theoretic direction to ask whether <i>and</i>
could be inserted, and if so use the comma, but not otherwise. These
both sound sufficient in the abstract. But that there are doubts left
in practice is shown by the type sentence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span> which Beadnell gives
as correct, though either test would rather require the comma. He
gives also as correct, Can flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of
death?—which is not very clearly distinguishable from the other. Our
advice is to use these tests when in doubt, but with a leaning to the
omission of the comma. If it happens that a comma of this particular
class is the only stop in a sentence, it has a false appearance of
dividing the sentence into two parts that is very unpleasant, and may
make the reader go through it twice to make sure that all is right—an
inconvenience that should by all means be spared him.</p>

<p>Type (<i>d</i>) is one in which the final word or phrase of a sentence
has two previous expressions standing in the same grammatical relation
to it, but their ending with different prepositions, or the fact
that one is to be substituted for the other, or the length of the
expressions, or some other cause, obscures this identity of relation.
Add to the type sentence the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His eloquence was the main, one might almost say the sole, source of
his influence.—<span class="smcap">Bryce.</span></p>

<p>To dazzle people more, he learned or pretended to learn, the Spanish
language.—<span class="smcap">Bagehot.</span></p>

<p>... apart from philosophical and sometimes from theological,
theories.—<span class="smcap">Balfour.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The rules we lay down are: (1) If possible use no stops at all. (2)
Never use the second comma and omit the first. (3) Even when the first
is necessary, the second may often be dispensed with. (4) Both commas
may be necessary if the phrases are long.</p>

<p>We should correct all the examples, including the type: the type under
rule (1); the Bryce (which is strictly correct) under rule (3); the
Bagehot under rules (2) and (1); and the Balfour under rules (2) and
(3); the list two are clearly wrong. The four would then stand as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Many states are in alliance with and under the protection of France.</p>

<p>His eloquence was the main, one might almost say the sole source of
his influence.</p>

<p>To dazzle people more, he learned or pretended to learn the Spanish
language.</p>

<p>... apart from philosophical, and sometimes from theological theories.</p>
</div>

<p>Learners will be inclined to say: all this is very indefinite; do
give us a clear rule that will apply to all cases. Such was the view
with which, on a matter of even greater importance than punctuation,
Procrustes identified himself; but it brought him to a bad end. The
clear rule, Use all logical commas, would give us:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was born, in, or near, London, on December 24th, 1900.</p>
</div>

<p>No one would write this who was not suffering from bad hypertrophy of
the grammatical conscience. The clear rule, Use no commas in this sort
of enumeration, would give:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If I have the queer ways you accuse me of, that is because but I
should have thought a man of your perspicacity might have been
expected to see that it was also why I live in a hermitage all by
myself.</p>
</div>

<p>No one would write this without both commas (after <i>because</i> and
<i>why</i>) who was not deeply committed to an anti-comma crusade.
Between the two extremes lie cases calling for various treatment; the
ruling principle should be freedom within certain limits.</p>

<p>8. The comma between independent sentences.</p>

<p>Among the signs that more particularly betray the uneducated writer is
inability to see when a comma is not a sufficient stop. Unfortunately
little more can be done than to warn beginners that any serious slip
here is much worse than they will probably suppose, and recommend them
to observe the practice of good writers.</p>

<p>It is roughly true that grammatically independent sentences should be
parted by at least a semicolon; but in the first place there are very
large exceptions to this; and secondly, the writer who really knows a
grammatically independent sentence when he sees it is hardly in need of
instruction;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span> this must be our excuse for entering here into what may
be thought too elementary an explanation. Let us take the second point
first; it may be of some assistance to remark that a sentence joined
to the previous one by a coordinating conjunction is grammatically
independent, as well as one not joined to it at all. But the difference
between a coordinating and a subordinating conjunction is itself in
English rather fine. Every one can see that ‘I will not try; it is
dangerous’ is two independent sentences—independent in grammar,
though not in thought. But it is a harder saying that ‘I will not try,
for it is dangerous’ is also two sentences, while ‘I will not try,
because it is dangerous’ is one only. The reason is that <i>for</i>
coordinates, and <i>because</i> subordinates; instead of giving lists,
which would probably be incomplete, of the two kinds of conjunction,
we mention that a subordinating conjunction may be known from the
other kind by its being possible to place it and its clause before
the previous sentence instead of after, without destroying the sense:
we can say ‘Because it is dangerous, I will not try’, but not ‘For it
is dangerous, I will not try’. This test cannot always be applied in
complicated sentences; simple ones must be constructed for testing the
conjunction in question.</p>

<p>Assuming that it is now understood (1) what a subordinating and what
a coordinating conjunction is, (2) that a member joined on by no
more than a coordinating conjunction is a grammatically independent
sentence, or simply a sentence in the proper meaning of the word,
and not a subordinate clause, we return to the first point. This was
that, though independent sentences are regularly parted by at least
a semicolon, there are large exceptions to the rule. These we shall
only be able to indicate very loosely. There are three conditions
that may favour the reduction of the semicolon to a comma: (1) Those
coordinating conjunctions which are most common tend in the order of
their commonness to be humble, and to recognize a comma as sufficient
for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> dignity. The order may perhaps be given as: <i>and</i>,
<i>or</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>nor</i>, <i>for</i>; conjunctions
less common than these should scarcely ever be used with less than
a semicolon; and many good writers would refuse to put a mere comma
before <i>for</i>. (2) Shortness and lightness of the sentence joined
on helps to lessen the need for a heavy stop. (3) Intimate connexion
in thought with the preceding sentence has the same effect. Before
giving our examples, which are all of undesirable commas, we point
out that in the first two there are independent signs of the writers’
being uneducated; and such signs will often be discoverable. It will
be clear from what we have said why the others are bad—except perhaps
the third; it is particularly disagreeable to have two successive
independent sentences tagged on with commas, as those beginning with
<i>nor</i> and <i>for</i> are in that example.</p>

touched upon in Understopping, that though a light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> <i>and</i>-clause
may be introduced by no more than a comma, it does not follow that it
need not be separated by any stop at all, as in:</p>

</div>

<p>9. The semicolon between subordinate members.</p>

<p>Just as the tiro will be safer if he avoids commas before independent
sentences, so he will generally be wise not to use a semicolon before
a mere subordinate member. We have explained, indeed, that it is
sometimes quite legitimate for rhetorical reasons, and is under certain
circumstances almost required by proportion. This is when the sentence
contains commas doing less important work than the one about which the
question arises. But the tiro’s true way out of the difficulty is to
simplify his sentences so that they do not need such differentiation.
Even skilful writers, as the following two quotations will show,
sometimes come to grief over this.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>In the first of these the second comma and the semicolon clearly ought
to change places. In the second it looks as if Carlyle had thought
it dull to have so many commas about; but the remedy was much worse
than dullness. Avoidance of what a correspondent supposes to be dull,
but what would in fact be natural and right, accounts also for the
following piece of vicarious rhetoric; the writer is not nearly so
excited, it may be suspected, as his semicolons would make him out.
The ordinary sensible man would have (1) used commas, and (2) either
omitted the third and fourth <i>denies</i> (reminding us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> of Zola’s
famous <i>j’accuse</i>, not vicarious, and on an adequate occasion), or
else inserted an <i>and</i> before the last repetition.</p>

he agreed with Mr. Meyers or anybody else to use his influence for

</div>

<p>10. The exclamation mark when there is no exclamation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My friend! this conduct amazes me!—B.</p>

<p>We must differ altogether from Beadnell’s rule that ‘This point is
used to denote any sudden emotion of the mind, whether of joy, grief,
surprise, fear, or any other sensation’—at least as it is exemplified
in his first instance, given above. The exclamation mark after
<i>friend</i> is justifiable, not the other. The stop should be used,
with one exception, only after real exclamations. Real exclamations
include (1) the words recognized as interjections, as <i>alas</i>,
(2) fragmentary expressions that are not complete sentences, as <i>My
friend</i> in the example, and (3) complete statements that contain an
exclamatory word, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What a piece of work is man!—B.</p>
</div>

<p>The exception mentioned above is this: when the writer wishes to
express his own incredulity or other feeling about what is not his own
statement, but practically a quotation from some one else, he is at
liberty to do it with a mark of exclamation; in the following example,
the epitaph-writer expresses either his wonder or his incredulity about
what Fame says.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Entomb’d within this vault a lawyer lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, Fame assureth us, was just and wise!—B.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The exclamation mark is a neat and concise sneer at the legal
profession.</p>

<p>Outside these narrow limits the exclamation mark must not be used. We
shall quote a very instructive saying of Landor’s: ‘I read warily;
and whenever I find the writings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> of a lady, the first thing I do
is to cast my eye along her pages, to see whether I am likely to be
annoyed by the traps and spring-guns of interjections; and if I happen
to espy them I do not leap the paling’. To this we add that when the
exclamation mark is used after mere statements it deserves the name,
by which it is sometimes called, mark of admiration; we feel that the
writer is indeed lost in admiration of his own wit or impressiveness.
But this use is mainly confined to lower-class authors; when a grave
historian stoops to it, he gives us quite a different sort of shock
from what he designed.</p>

<p>What wonder that the most docile of Russians should be crying out ‘how
long’!—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We have started with three indisputable instances of the exclamation
mark used for the question mark. It is worth notice that the correct
stopping for the end of the second quotation (though such accuracy
is seldom attempted) would be:—long?’? To have fused two questions
into an exclamation is an achievement. But these are mere indefensible
blunders, not needing to be thought twice about, such as author and
compositor incline to put off each on the other’s shoulders.</p>

<p>The case is not always so clear. In the six sentences lettered for
reference, <i>a</i>-<i>d</i> have the wrong stop; in <i>e</i> the
stop implied by <i>he exclaims</i> is also wrong; in <i>f</i>, though
the stop is right assuming that the form of the sentence is what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
really meant, we venture to question this point, as we do also in
some of the earlier sentences. Any one who agrees with the details of
this summary can save himself the trouble of reading the subsequent
discussion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>a.</i> In that interval what had I not lost!—<span class="smcap">Lamb.</span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> And what will not the discontinuance cost
me!—<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> A streak of blue below the hanging alders is certainly a
characteristic introduction to the kingfisher. How many people first
see him so?—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p><i>d.</i> Does the reading of history make us fatalists? What courage
does not the opposite opinion show!—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

<p><i>e.</i> What economy of life and money, he exclaims, would not have
been spared the empire of the Tsars had it not rendered war certain by
devoting itself so largely to the works of peace.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p><i>f.</i> How many, who think no otherwise than the
young painter, have we not heard disbursing secondhand
hyperboles?—<span class="smcap">Stevenson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that in all these sentences except <i>c</i> there is
a negative, which puts them, except <i>f</i>, wrong; while in <i>c</i>
it is the absence of the negative that makes the question wrong. It
will be simplest to start with <i>c</i>. The writer clearly means to
let us know that many people see the kingfisher first as a blue streak.
He might give this simply so, as a statement. He might (artificially)
give it as an exclamation—<i>How many first see him so!</i> Or he
might (very artificially) give it as a question—<i>How many do not
first see him so?</i>—a ‘rhetorical question’ in which <i>How many</i>
interrogative is understood to be equivalent to <i>Few</i> positive. He
has rejected the simple statement; vaulting ambition has o’erleapt, and
he has ended in a confusion between the two artificial ways of saying
the thing, taking the words of the possible exclamation and the stop of
the possible question. In <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, and implicitly
in <i>e</i>, we have the converse arrangement, or derangement. But as
a little more clear thinking is required for them, we point out that
the origin of the confusion (though the careless printing of fifty
or a hundred years ago no doubt helped to establish it) lies in the
identity between the words used for questions and for exclamations. It
will be enough to suggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> the process that accounts for <i>a</i>; the
ambiguity is easily got rid of by inserting a noun with <i>what</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Question</i>: What amount had I lost?</p>

<p><i>Exclamation</i>: What an amount I had lost!</p>
</div>

<p>That is the first stage; the resemblance is next increased by inverting
subject and verb in the exclamation, which is both natural enough
in that kind of sentence, and particularly easy after <i>In that
interval</i>. So we get</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Question</i>: In that interval, what (amount) had I lost?</p>

<p><i>Exclamation</i>: In that interval, what (an amount) had I lost!</p>
</div>

<p>The words, when the bracketed part of each sentence is left out, are
now the same; but the question is of course incapable of giving the
required meaning. The writer, seeing this, but deceived by the order
of words into thinking the exclamation a question, tries to mend it by
inserting <i>not</i>; <i>what ... not</i>, in rhetorical questions,
being equivalent to <i>everything</i>. At this stage some writers
stick, as Stevenson in <i>f</i>. Others try to make a right out of two
wrongs by restoring to the quondam exclamation, which has been wrongly
converted with the help of <i>not</i> into a question, the exclamation
mark to which it has after conversion no right. Such is the genesis
of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>. The proper method, when the simple
statement is rejected, as it often reasonably may be, is to use the
exclamation, not the Stevensonian question<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, to give the exclamation
its right mark, and not to insert the illogical negative.</p>

<p>12. Internal question and exclamation marks.</p>

<p>By this name we do not mean that insertion of a bracketed stop of which
we shall nevertheless give one example. That is indeed a confession of
weakness and infallible sign of the prentice hand, and further examples
will be found in <i>Airs and Graces</i>, <i>miscellaneous</i>; but it
is outside grammar, with which these sections are concerned.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it would be interesting to ascertain
the exact position of landlords whose tenants decline to pay rent,

<p>What is meant is the ugly stop in the middle of a sentence, unbracketed
and undefended by quotation marks, of which examples follow. To
novelists, as in the first example, it may be necessary for the purpose
of avoiding the nuisance of perpetual quotation marks. But elsewhere
it should be got rid of by use of the indirect question or otherwise.
Excessive indulgence in direct questions or exclamations where there
is no need for them whatever is one of the sensational tendencies of
modern newspapers.</p>

<p>13. The unaccountable comma.</p>

<p>We shall now conclude these grammatical sections with a single example
of those commas about which it is only possible to say that they are
repugnant to grammar. It is as difficult to decide what principle they
offend against as what impulse can possibly have dictated them. They
are commonest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> the least educated writers of all; and, next to
these, in the men of science whose overpowering conscientiousness has
made the mechanical putting in of commas so habitual that it perhaps
becomes with them a sort of reflex action, and does itself at wrong
moments without their volition.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Colon</span></h3>

<p>It was said in the general remarks at the beginning of this chapter
that the systematic use of the colon as one of the series (,), (;),
(:), (.), had died out with the decay of formal periods. Many people
continue to use it, but few, if we can trust our observation, with any
nice regard to its value. Some think it a prettier or more impressive
stop than the semicolon, and use it instead of that; some like variety,
and use the two indifferently, or resort to one when they are tired
of the other. As the abandonment of periodic arrangement really makes
the colon useless, it would be well (though of course any one who
still writes in formal periods should retain his rights over it) if
ordinary writers would give it up altogether except in the special
uses, independent of its quantitative value, to which it is being more
and more applied by common consent. These are (1) between two sentences
that are in clear antithesis, but not connected by an adversative
conjunction; (2) introducing a short quotation; (3) introducing a
list; (4) introducing a sentence that comes as fulfilment of a promise
expressed or implied in the previous sentence; (5) introducing an
explanation or proof that is not connected with the previous sentence
by <i>for</i> or the like. Examples are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Man proposes: God disposes.</p>

<p>(2) Always remember the ancient maxim: Know thyself.—B.</p>

<p>(3) Chief rivers: Thames, Severn, Humber....</p>

<p>(4) Some things we can, and others we cannot do: we can walk, but we

according to modern usage than the semicolon.</p>

</div>

<p>It now only remains, before leaving actual stops for the dash, hyphen,
quotation mark, and bracket, to comment on a few stray cases of
ambiguity, false scent, and ill-judged stopping. We have not hunted
up, and shall not manufacture, any of the patent absurdities that
are amusing but unprofitable. The sort of ambiguity that most needs
guarding against is that which allows a sleepy reader to take the words
wrong when the omission or insertion of a stop would have saved him.</p>

considering the favours showered upon them in the past—a high sense

agitators not unnaturally consider; second thoughts put it right; but
second thoughts should never be expected from a reader.</p>

<p>Simultaneously extensive reclamation of land and harbour improvements

journalese for <i>equally extensive</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>A comma after <i>together</i> would save us from adding the two sets
of years to each other. In the next piece, on the other hand, the
uncomfortable comma after <i>gold</i> is apparently meant to warn us
quite unnecessarily that <i>here and there</i> belongs to the verb.</p>

<p>Flecks of straw-coloured gold, here and there lay upon it, where the

</div>

<p>The omission of the comma between <i>and</i> and <i>beating</i> would
ordinarily be quite legitimate. Here, it puts us off on a false scent,
because it allows <i>beating</i> to seem parallel with <i>crossing</i>
and object to <i>succeeded in</i>; we have to go back again when we get
to the end, and work it out.</p>

are disappointed.</p>

position on stopping. This is one of the numberless small disturbing

<p>The half adverbs half conjunctions of which <i>therefore</i> and
<i>however</i> are instances occupy usually the second place in the
sentence. When there, it is of little importance whether they are
stopped or not, though we have indicated our preference for no stops.
But when it happens that they come later (or earlier), the commas are
generally wanted. <i>Therefore</i> in the first of these sentences
would be as uncomfortable if stripped as <i>however</i> actually is in
the second.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dashes</span></h3>

<p>Moved beyond his wont by our English ill-treatment of the dash,
Beadnell permits himself a wail as just as it is pathetic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The dash is frequently employed in a very capricious and arbitrary
manner, as a substitute for all sorts of points, by writers whose
thoughts, although, it may be, sometimes striking and profound, are
thrown together without order or dependence; also by some others, who
think that they thereby give prominence and emphasis to expressions
which in themselves are very commonplace, and would, without this
fictitious assistance, escape the observation of the reader, or be
deemed by him hardly worthy of notice.’</p>
</div>

<p>It is all only too true; these are the realms of Chaos, and the lord
of them is Sterne, from whom modern writers of the purely literary
kind have so many of their characteristics. Wishing for an example, we
merely opened the first volume of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> at a venture,
and ‘thus the Anarch old With faltering speech and visage incomposed
Answered’:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>—Observe, I determine nothing upon this.—My way is ever to point
out to the curious, different tracts of investigation, to come at the
first springs of the events I tell;—not with a pedantic fescue,—or
in the decisive manner of Tacitus, who outwits himself and his
reader;—but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the
assistance merely of the inquisitive;—to them I write,—and by them I
shall be read,—if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold
out so long,—to the very end of the world.—<span class="smcap">Sterne.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The modern newspaper writer who overdoes the use of dashes is seldom as
incorrect as Sterne, but is perhaps more irritating:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are also a great number of people—many of them not in the
least tainted by militarism—who go further and who feel that a man
in order to be a complete man—that is, one capable of protecting

acquire as a boy and youth the elements of military training,—that
is, should be given a physical training of a military character,
including....—<i>Spectator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It must be added, however, that Beadnell himself helps to make things
worse, by countenancing the strange printer’s superstition that (,—)
is beautiful to look upon, and (—,) ugly.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we shall have to abandon our usual practice
of attending only to common mistakes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span> deal with the matter a
little more systematically. We shall first catalogue, with examples,
the chief uses of the dash; next state the debatable questions that
arise; and end with the more definite misuses. It will be convenient
to number all examples for reference; and, as many or most of the
quotations contain some minor violation of what we consider the true
principles, these will be corrected in brackets.</p>

<p>1. Chief common uses.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Adding to a phrase already used an explanation, example, or
preferable substitute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Nicholas Copernicus was instructed in that seminary where it is
always happy when any one can be well taught,—the family circle.—B.

colleagues the most rational theory,—a theory in harmony with the

</div>

<p><i>b.</i> Inviting the reader to pause and collect his forces against
the shock of an unexpected word that is to close the sentence. It is
generally, but not always, better to abstain from this device; the
unexpected, if not drawn attention to, is often more effective because
less theatrical.</p>

unexpected, is witty. Writers should be exceedingly sparing of this
use; good wine needs no bush.</p>

from high farming to a taste for the junior stage, and—the

after a subordinate clause or a subject that is long or compound.</p>

<p>6. As soon as the queen shall come to London, and the houses of
Parliament shall be opened, and the speech from the throne be
delivered,—then will begin the great struggle of the contending
factions.—B.</p>
</div>

<p><i>e.</i> Resuming after a parenthesis or long phrase, generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span> with
repetition of some previous words in danger of being forgotten.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7. It is now idle to attempt to hide the fact that never was the
Russian lack of science, of the modern spirit, or, to speak frankly,
of intelligence—never was the absence of training or of enthusiasm
which retards the efforts of the whole Empire displayed in a more
melancholy fashion than in the Sea of Japan.—<i>Times.</i> (Add a
comma after <i>intelligence</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>f.</i> Giving the air of an afterthought to a final comment that
would spoil the balance of the sentence if preceded only by an ordinary
stop. Justifiable when really wanted, that is, when it is important to
keep the comment till the end; otherwise it is slightly insulting to
the reader, implying that he was not worth working out the sentence for
before it was put down.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>8. As they parted, she insisted on his giving the most solemn
promises that he would not expose himself to danger—which was quite
unnecessary.</p>

said’, &amp;c., are not used; or, in a single speech, a change of subject
or person addressed.</p>

construction for the one started with.</p>

that well undefiled, in which heaven itself seems to be
reflected?—<span class="smcap">Bigelow.</span> (Omit the comma)</p>

<p><i>l.</i> Breaking off a sentence altogether.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p><i>m.</i> Doubled to serve the purpose of brackets. It gives a medium
between the light comma parenthesis and the heavy bracket parenthesis.
It also has the advantage over brackets that when the parenthesis
ends only with the sentence the second dash need not be given; this
advantage, however, may involve ambiguity, as will be shown.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>16. In every well regulated community—such as that of England,—the
laws own no superior.—B. (The comma should either be omitted or
placed after instead of before the second dash).</p>
</div>

<p>These are a dozen distinct uses of more or less value or importance,
to which others might no doubt be added; but they will suffice both to
show that the dash is a hard-worked symbol, and to base our remarks
upon.</p>

<p>2. Debatable questions.</p>

<p>There are several questions that must be answered before we can use
the dash with confidence. First, is the dash to supersede stops at the
place where it is inserted, or to be added to them? Secondly, what is
its relation to the stops in the part of the sentence (or group of
sentences) that follows it? Does its authority, that is, extend to the
end of the sentence or group, or where does it cease? Thirdly, assuming
that it is or can be combined with stops, what is the right order as
between the two?</p>

<p>Beadnell’s answer to the first question is: <i>The dash does not
dispense with the use of the ordinary points at the same time, when
the grammatical construction of the sentence requires them.</i> But
inasmuch as a dash implies some sort of break, irregular pause, or
change of intention, it seems quite needless to insert the stop that
would have been used if it had not been decided that a stop was
inadequate. The dash is a confession that the stop will not do; then
let the stop go. The reader, who is the person to be considered,
generally neither knows nor cares to know how the sentence might,
with inferior effect, have been written; he only feels that the stop
is otiose, and that his author had better have been off with the old
love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> before he was on with the new. There are exceptions to this:
obviously in examples 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15, where the dash is at the
end or beginning of a sentence; and perhaps also in sentences of which
the reader can clearly foresee the grammatical development. In example
7, for instance, it is clear that a participle (<i>displayed</i>
or another) is due after <i>never was</i> &amp;c.; a comma after
<i>intelligence</i> is therefore definitely expected. So in example
6 we are expecting either another continuation of <i>as soon as</i>,
or the principal sentence, before either of which a comma is looked
for. In examples 2 and 3, on the other hand, the sentence may for all
we know be complete at the place where the dash stands, so that no
expectation is disappointed by omitting the comma. The rule, then,
should be that a dash is a substitute for any internal stop, and not
an addition to it, except when, from the reader’s point of view, a
particular stop seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that that conclusion is not very certain, and also
that the matter is of no great importance, provided that the stops,
if inserted, are the right ones. More certainty is possible about
the combination of stops with the double dash, which we have not yet
considered. The probable origin of the double dash will be touched
upon when we come to the second question; but whatever its origin,
it is now simply equivalent to a pair of brackets, except that it is
slightly less conspicuous, and sometimes preferred on that account.
Consequently, the same rule about stops will apply to both, and as
there is no occasion to treat of brackets separately, it may here be
stated for both. The use of a parenthesis being to insert, without
damage to the rest of the sentence, something that is of theoretically
minor importance, it is necessary that we should be able simply to
remove the two dashes or brackets with everything enclosed by them, and
after their removal find the sentence complete and rightly punctuated.
Further, there is no reason for using inside the parenthesis any stop
that has not an internal value; that is, no stop can possibly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
needed just before the second dash except an exclamation or question
mark, and none at all just after the first; but stops may be necessary
to divide up the parenthesis itself if it is compound. Three examples
follow, with the proper corrections in brackets:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>17. Garinet cites the case of a girl near Amiens possessed by three
demons,—Mimi, Zozo, and Crapoulet,—in 1816.—<span class="smcap">Lowell.</span> (Omit
both commas; the first is indeed just possible, though not required,
in the principal sentence; the last is absolutely meaningless in the
parenthesis)</p>

<p>18. Its visions and its delights are too penetrating,—too
living,—for any white-washed object or shallow fountain long to
endure or to supply.—<span class="smcap">Ruskin.</span> (Omit both commas; this time
the first is as impossible in the principal sentence as the second is
meaningless in the parenthesis)</p>

<p>19. The second carries us on from 1625 to 1714—less than a
century—yet the walls of the big hall in the Examination Schools are
not only well covered....—<i>Times.</i> (Insert a comma, as necessary
to the principal sentence, outside the dashes; whether before the
first or after the last will be explained in our answer to the third
question)</p>
</div>

<p>The second question is, how far the authority of the dash extends.
There is no reason, in the nature of things, why we should not on
the one hand be relieved of it by the next stop, or on the other be
subject to it till the paragraph ends. The three following examples,
which we shall correct in brackets by anticipation, but which we shall
also assume not to be mere careless blunders, seem to go on the first
hypothesis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>20. The Moral Nature, that Law of laws, whose revelations
introduce greatness—yea, God himself, into the open soul, is not
explored.—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span> (Substitute a dash for the comma after
<i>himself</i>. Here, however, Emerson expects us to terminate the
authority at the right comma rather than at the first that comes,
making things worse)</p>

<p>21. I ... there complained of the common notions of the special
virtues—justice, &amp;c., as too vague to furnish exact determinations of
the actions enjoined under them.—<span class="smcap">H. Sidgwick.</span> (Substitute a
dash for the comma after <i>&amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p>22. There are vicars and vicars, and of all sorts I love an
innovating vicar—a piebald progressive professional reactionary, the
least.—<span class="smcap">H. G. Wells.</span> (Substitute a dash for the comma after
<i>reactionary</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>It needs no further demonstration, however, that commas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span> are frequently
used after a dash without putting an end to its influence; and if they
are to be sometimes taken, nevertheless, as doing so, confusion is sure
to result. Unless the author of the next example is blind to the danger
that two neighbouring but independent dashes may be mistaken for a
parenthetic pair, he must have assumed that the authority of a dash is
terminated at any rate by a semicolon; that, if true, would obviate the
danger.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>23. It is a forlorn hope, however excellent the translation—and Mr.
Hankin’s could not be bettered; or however careful the playing—and
the playing at the Stage Society performance was meticulously
careful.—<i>Times.</i> (Insert a dash between <i>bettered</i> and the
semicolon, which then need not be more than a comma)</p>
</div>

<p>But that it is not true will probably be admitted on the strength of
sentences like:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>24. There may be differences of opinion on the degrees—no one takes
white for black: most people sometimes take blackish for black—, but
that is not fatal to my argument.</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, we doubt whether a full stop is ever allowed to
stand in the middle of a dash parenthesis, as it of course may in a
bracket parenthesis. The reason for the distinction is clear. When we
have had a left-hand bracket we know for certain that a right-hand
one is due, full stops or no full stops; but when we have had a dash,
we very seldom know for certain that it is one of a pair; and the
appearance of a full stop would be too severe a trial of our faith.
It seems natural to suppose that the double-dash parenthesis is thus
accounted for: the construction started with a single dash; but as it
was often necessary to revert to the main construction, the second
dash was resorted to as a declaration that the close time, or state of
siege, was over. The rule we deduce is: All that follows a dash is to
be taken as under its influence until either a second dash terminates
it, or a full stop is reached.</p>

<p>Our answer to the third question has already been given by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
implication; but it may be better to give it again explicitly. We first
refer to examples 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 14, 24, in all of which the stop, if
one is to be used, though our view is that in most of these sentences
it should not, is in the right place; and to example 16, in which it is
in the wrong place. We next add two new examples of wrong order, with
corrections as usual; the rules for stops with brackets are the same as
with double dashes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>25. Throughout the parts which they are intended to make most
personally their own, (the Psalms,) it is always the Law which is
spoken of with chief joy.—<span class="smcap">Ruskin.</span> (Remove both commas, and
use according to taste either none at all, or one after the second
bracket)</p>

<p>26. What is the difference, whether land and sea interact, and worlds
revolve and intermingle without number or end,—deep yawning under
deep, and galaxy balancing galaxy, throughout absolute space,—or,
whether....—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span> (Remove both commas, and place one
after the second dash)</p>
</div>

<p>A protest must next be made against the compositor’s superstition
embodied in Beadnell’s words: <i>As the dash in this case supplies the
place of the parenthesis, strictly speaking, the grammatical point
should follow the last dash; but as this would have an unsightly
appearance, it is always placed before it.</i> This unsightliness is
either imaginary or at most purely conventional, and should be entirely
disregarded. The rules will be (1) For the single dash: Since the dash
is on any view either a correction of or an addition to the stop that
would have been used if dashes had not existed, the dash will always
stand after the stop. (2) For the double dash or brackets: There will
be one stop or none according to the requirements of the principal
sentence only; there will never be two stops (apart, of course, from
internal ones); if there is one, it will stand before the first or
after the last dash or bracket according as the parenthesis belongs to
the following or the preceding part of the principal sentence. It may
be added that it is extremely rare for the parenthesis to belong to
the last part, and therefore for the stop to be rightly placed before
it. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> the following example constructed for the occasion it does so
belong; but for practical purposes the rule might be that if a stop is
required it stands after the second dash or bracket.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>27. When I last saw him, (a singular fact) his nose was pea-green.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Common misuses.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> If two single independent dashes are placed near each other,
still more if they are in the same sentence, the reader naturally takes
them for a pair constituting a parenthesis, and has to reconsider the
sentence when he finds that his first reading gives nonsense. We refer
back to example 23. But this indiscretion is so common that it is well
to add some more. The sentences should be read over without the two
dashes and what they enclose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then there is also Miss Euphemia, long deposed from her office
of governess, but pensioned and so driven to good works and the

supposed.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>

<p>The English came mainly from the Germans, whom Rome found hard to

</div>

<p><i>b.</i> The first dash is inserted and the second forgotten. It will
suffice to refer back to examples 20, 21, 22.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Brackets and dashes are combined. It is a pity from the
collector’s point of view that Carlyle, being in the mood, did not
realize the full possibilities, and add a pair of commas, closing up
the parenthesis in <i>robur et aes triplex</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p><i>d.</i> Like the comma, the dash is sometimes misplaced by a word or
two. In the first example, the first dash should be one place later;
and in the second, unless we misread the sentence and this is another
case of two single dashes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> second dash should be two places
earlier, and itself be replaced by a comma.</p>

him, in his hut.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>e.</i> Dashes are sometimes used when an ordinary stop would serve
quite well. In the Lowell sentences, the reason why a comma is not
used is that the members are themselves broken up by commas, and
therefore demand a heavier stop to divide them from each other; this,
as explained in the early part of the chapter, is the place for a
semicolon. In the Corelli sentence, it is a question between comma and
semicolon, either of which would do quite well.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hyphens</span></h3>

<p>We return here to our usual practice of disregarding everything
not necessary for dealing with common mistakes. But some general
principles, most of which will probably find acceptance, will be useful
to start from.</p>

<p>1. Hyphens are regrettable necessities, and to be done without when
they reasonably may.</p>

<p>2. There are three degrees of intimacy between words, of which the
first and loosest is expressed by their mere juxtaposition as separate
words, the second by their being hyphened, and the third or closest
by their being written continuously as one word. Thus, hand workers,
hand-workers, handworkers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>3. It is good English usage to place a noun or other non-adjectival
part of speech before a noun, printing it as a separate word, and to
regard it as serving the purpose of an adjective in virtue of its
position; for instance, <i>war expenditure</i>; but there are sometimes
special objections to its being done. Thus, words in <i>-ing</i> may
be actual adjectives (participles), or nouns (gerunds), used in virtue
of their position as adjectives; and a visible distinction is needed.
A <i>walking stick</i> is a stick that walks, and the phrase might
occur as a metaphorical description of a stiffly behaved person: a
<i>walking-stick</i> or <i>walkingstick</i> is a stick for walking; the
difference may sometimes be important, and consistency may be held to
require that all compounds with gerunds should be hyphened or made into
single words.</p>

<p>4. Not only can a single word in ordinary circumstances be thus treated
as an adjective, but the same is true of a phrase; the words of the
phrase, however, must then be hyphened, or ambiguity may result. Thus:
Covent Garden; Covent-Garden Market; Covent-Garden-Market salesmen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The prevailing method of giving railway and street names, besides its
ungainliness, is often misleading and contrary to common sense. For
one difficulty we suggest recurrence to the old-fashioned formula with
commas, and <i>and</i>, as in <i>The London, Chatham, and Dover</i>.
On another, it is to be observed that <i>New York-street</i> should
mean the new part of York Street, but <i>New-York Street</i> the street
named after New York. The set of examples includes some analogous
cases, besides the railway and street names.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is stated that the train service on the
Hsin-min-tun-Kau-pan-tse-Yingkau section of the Imperial Chinese
Railway will be restored within a few days.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Hsinmintun, Kaupantse, and Yingkau. These places can surely do without
their internal hyphens in an English newspaper; and one almost
suspects, from the absence of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> hyphen between <i>Ying</i> and
<i>kau</i>, that the <i>Times’s</i> stock must have run short.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even third-class carriages are scarce on the Dalny-Port Arthur
line.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Dalny and Port-Arthur line. By general principle 4, though <i>Port
Arthur</i> needs no hyphen by itself, it does as soon as it stands
for an adjective with <i>line</i>: the Port-Arthur line. Also, by 2,
the <i>Times</i> version implies that <i>Dalny</i> is more closely
connected with <i>Port</i> than <i>Port</i> with <i>Arthur</i>. We
do indeed most of us know at present that there is no Dalny Port so
called, and that there is a Port Arthur. But in the next example, who
would know that there was a Brest Litovski, but for the sentence that
follows?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A general strike has been declared on the Warsaw-Brest Litovski
railway. The telegraph stations at Praga, Warsaw, and Brest Litovski

</div>

<p>The Warsaw and Brest-Litovski railway. By 4, the hyphen between
<i>Brest</i> and <i>Litovski</i> is necessary. If we write
<i>Warsaw-Brest-Litovski</i>, it is natural to suppose that three
places are meant; the <i>and</i> solution is accordingly the best.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Bow-street, Robert Marsh, greengrocer, of Great Western-road,

</div>

<p>Great-Western Road, Harrow Road. Bow-street, as <i>at</i> (not
<i>in</i>) shows, is a compound epithet for <i>police-court</i>
understood, and has a right to its hyphen. By 3, there is no need
for a hyphen after <i>Harrow</i>, and by 1, if unnecessary, it is
undesirable. As to the other road, there are three possibilities. The
<i>Times</i> is right if there is a <i>Western Road</i> of which one
section is called <i>Great</i>, and the other <i>Little</i>. If the
name means literally the great road that runs west, there should be no
hyphen at all. If the road is named from the Great Western Railway, or
from the Great-Western Hotel, our version is right.</p>

dear,’ which Dorcas sent her as a remembrance.—<span class="smcap">Eliot.</span></p>

<p>This evidently means a box made of china. A box to hold china would
have the hyphen properly, and there are many differentiations of this
kind, of which <i>black bird</i>, as opposed to <i>black-bird</i> or
<i>blackbird</i>, is the type.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bertie took up a quantity of waste-papers, and thrust them down into

</div>

<p>This is probably formed by a mistaken step backwards from
<i>waste-paper basket</i>, where the hyphen is correct, as explained in
3.</p>

<p>In phrases like <i>wet and dry fly fishing</i>, compounded of
<i>wet-fly fishing</i> and <i>dry-fly fishing</i>, methods vary. For
instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A low door, leading through a moss and ivy-covered
wall.—<span class="smcap">Scott.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></span></p>

mongers.—<span class="smcap">Lowell.</span></p>

<p>Those who take human or womankind for their study.—<span class="smcap">Thackeray.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The single phrases would have the hyphen for different reasons
(<i>moss-covered</i>, &amp;c.), all but <i>human kind</i>. The only quite
satisfactory plan is the Germans’, who would write <i>moss-</i> and
<i>ivy-covered</i>. This is imitated in English, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In old woods and on fern-and gorse-covered hilltops they do no harm
whatever.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>Refreshment-, boarding-, and lodging-house keepers have suffered
severely too.—<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But imitations of foreign methods are not much to be recommended;
failing that, Lowell’s method seems the best—to use no hyphens, and
keep the second compound separate.</p>

<p>Adverbs that practically form compounds with verbs, but stand after,
and not necessarily next after them, need not be hyphened unless
they would be ambiguous in the particular sentence if they were
not hyphened. This may often happen, since most of them are also
prepositions; but even then, it is better to rearrange the sentence
than to hyphen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thoughtful persons, unpledged to shore-up tottering

</div>

<p>It is a much commoner fault to over-hyphen than to under-hyphen. But
in the next example <i>malaria-infected</i> must be written, by 3. And
in the next again, one of the differentiations we have spoken of is
disregarded; <i>the fifty first</i> means the fifty that come first:
<i>the fifty-first</i> is the one after fifty. The ambiguity in the
third example is obvious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>There comes a time when compound words that have long had a hyphen
should drop it; this is when they have become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span> quite familiar. It
seems absurd to keep any longer the division in <i>to-day</i> and
<i>to-morrow</i>; there are no words in the language that are more
definitely single and not double words; so much so that the ordinary
man can give no explanation of the <i>to</i>. On the other hand, the
word italicized in the next example may well puzzle a good many readers
without its hyphen; it has quite lately come into use in this country
(‘Chiefly U.S.’ says the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i>, which prints the
hyphen, whereas Webster does not), and is in danger of being taken at
first sight for a foreign word and pronounced in strange ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The soldiers ... have been building <i>dugouts</i> throughout
April.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There is a tendency to write certain familiar combinations
irrationally, which may be mentioned here, though it does not
necessarily involve the hyphen. With <i>in no wise</i> and <i>at
any rate</i>, the only rational possibilities are to treat them
like <i>nevertheless</i> as one word, or like <i>none the less</i>
as three words (the right way, by usage), or give them two hyphens.
<i>Nowise</i> and <i>anyrate</i> are not nouns that can be governed by
<i>in</i> and <i>at</i>.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quotation Marks</span></h3>

<p>Quotation marks, like hyphens, should be used only when necessary.
The degree of necessity will vary slightly with the mental state of
the audience for whom a book is intended. To an educated man it is
an annoyance to find his author warning him that something written
long ago, and quoted every day almost ever since, is not an original
remark now first struck out. On the other hand, writers who address
the uneducated may find their account in using all the quotation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
marks they can; their readers may be gratified by seeing how well read
the author is, or may think quotation marks decorative. The following
examples start with the least justifiable uses, and stop at the point
where quotation marks become more or less necessary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Smith, Esq., ‘Chatsworth’, Melton Road, Leamington.</p>

tautology, after <i>so to speak</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A question of some importance to writers who trouble themselves about
accuracy, though no doubt the average reader is profoundly indifferent,
is that of the right order as between quotation marks and stops.
Besides the conflict in which we shall again find ourselves with the
aesthetic compositor, it is really difficult to arrive at a completely
logical system. Before laying down what seems the best attainable, we
must warn the reader that it is not the system now in fashion; but
there are signs that printers are feeling their way towards better
things, and this is an attempt to anticipate what they will ultimately
come to. We shall make one or two postulates, deduce rules, and give
examples. After the examples (in order that readers who are content
either to go on with the present compromise or to accept our rules
may be able to skip the discussion), we shall consider some possible
objections.</p>

<p>No stop is ever required at the end of a quotation to separate the
quotation, as such, from what follows; that is sufficiently done by the
quotation mark.</p>

<p>A stop is required to separate the containing sentence, which may go
on beyond the quotation’s end, but more commonly does not, from what
follows.</p>

<p>An exclamation or question mark—which are not true stops, but tone
symbols—may be an essential part of the quotation.</p>

<p>When a quotation is broken by such insertions as <i>he said</i>, any
stop or tone symbol may be an essential part of the first fragment of
quotation.</p>

<p>No stop is needed at either end of such insertions as <i>he said</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
to part them from the quotation, that being sufficiently done by the
quotation marks.</p>

<p>From these considerations we deduce the following rules:</p>

<p>1. The true stops should never stand before the second quotation mark
except</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) when, as in dialogue given without framework, complete
sentences entirely isolated and independent in grammar are printed as
quotations. Even in these, it must be mentioned that the true stops are
strictly unnecessary; but if the full stop (which alone can here be in
question) is used in deference to universal custom, it should be before
the quotation mark.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) when a stop is necessary to divide the first fragment of an
interrupted quotation from the second.</p>

<p>2. Words that interrupt quotations should never be allowed stops to
part them from the quotation.</p>

<p>3. The tone symbols should be placed before or after the second
quotation mark according as they belong to the quotation or to the
containing sentence. If both quotation and containing sentence need a
tone symbol, both should be used, with the quotation mark between them.</p>

<p>The bracketed numbers before the examples repeat the numbers of the
rules.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Views advocated by Dr. Whately in his well-known ‘Essays’;</p>

<p>It is enough for us to reflect that ‘Such shortlived wits do wither as
they grow’.</p>

<p>We hear that ‘whom the gods love die young’, and thenceforth we
collect the cases that illustrate it.</p>

<p>(1 <i>a</i>) ‘You are breaking the rules.’ ‘Well, the rules are silly.’</p>

<p>(1 <i>b</i>) ‘Certainly not;’ he exclaimed ‘I would have died rather’.</p>

<p>(3) But ‘why drag in Velasquez?’</p>

<p>But what is the use of saying ‘Call no man happy till he dies’?</p>

<p>Is the question ‘Where was he?’ or ‘What was he doing?’?</p>

<p>How absurd to ask ‘Can a thing both be and not be?’!</p>
</div>

<p>If indignation is excited by the last two monstrosities, we can only
say what has been implied many other times in this book, that the
right substitute for correct ugliness is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> incorrect prettiness,
but correct prettiness. There is never any difficulty in rewriting
sentences like these. (Is the question where he was, &amp;c.?) (‘Can a
thing both be and not be?’ The question is absurd.) But it should be
recognized that, if such sentences are to be written, there is only one
way to punctuate them.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to show how these sentences stand in the books.
1st sentence (‘Essays;’); 2nd (grow.’); 3rd (young,’); 4th, as here;
5th (not,’ he exclaimed;) (rather.’); 6th (guess,’ he retorted,)
(mean.’); 7th (Velasquez’?); 8th (saying,) (dies?’). The last two are
fabricated.</p>

<p>The objections may now be considered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The passing crowd’ is a phrase coined in the spirit of indifference.
Yet, to a man of what Plato calls ‘universal sympathies,’ and even
to the plain, ordinary denizens of this world, what can be more
interesting than ‘the passing crowd’?—B.</p>
</div>

<p>After giving this example, Beadnell says:—‘The reason is clear:
the words quoted are those of another, but the <i>question</i>
is the writer’s own. Nevertheless, for the sake of neatness, the
ordinary points, such as the comma, semicolon, colon, and full stop,
<i>precede</i> the quotation marks in instances analogous to the one
quoted; but the exclamation follows the same rule as the interrogation’.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, the stops that are according to this always to
precede the quotation mark (for the ‘analogous cases’ are the only
cases in which the outside position would be so much as considered) are
just the ones that by our rules ought hardly ever to do so, whereas the
two that are sometimes allowed the outside position are the two that we
admit to be as often necessary inside as outside. Neatness is the sole
consideration; just as the ears may be regarded as not hearing organs,
but ‘handsome volutes of the human capital’, so quotation marks may be
welcomed as giving a good picturesque finish to a sentence; those who
are of this way of thinking must feel that, if they allowed outside
them anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> short of fine handsome stops like the exclamation and
question marks, they would be countenancing an anticlimax. But they
are really mere conservatives, masquerading only as aesthetes; and
their conservatism will soon have to yield. Argument on the subject is
impossible; it is only a question whether the printer’s love for the
old ways that seem to him so neat, or the writer’s and reader’s desire
to be understood and to understand fully, is to prevail.</p>

<p>Another objector takes a stronger position. He admits that logic, and
not beauty, must decide: ‘but before we give up the old, let us be
sure we are giving it up for a new that is logical’. He invites our
attention to the recent paragraph containing Beadnell’s views. ‘Why,
in the last sentence of that paragraph, is the full stop outside?
“But the exclamation follows the same rule as the interrogation” is a
complete sentence, quoted; why should its full stop be separated from
it?’ The answer is that the full stop is not <i>its</i> full stop;
<i>it</i> needs no stop, having its communications forward absolutely
cut off by the quotation mark. It is a delusion to suppose that any
sentence has proprietary rights in a stop, though it may have in a
tone symbol; a stop is placed after it merely to separate it from
what follows, if necessary.—‘And the full stop after every last
sentence (not a question or exclamation) of a paragraph, chapter,
or book?’—Is illogical, and only to be allowed, like those in the
isolated quotations mentioned in rule (1 <i>a</i>), in deference to
universal custom. Our full stop belongs, not to the last sentence
of the quotation, but to the paragraph, which is all one sentence,
the whole quotation simply playing the part, helped by the quotation
marks, of object to <i>says</i>.—‘But <i>says</i> is followed by a
colon, and a colon between verb and object breaks your own rules.’—No;
(:—) is something different from a stop; it is an extra quotation
mark, as much a conventional symbol as the full stop in M.A. and
other abbreviations.—‘Well, then, instead of <i>says</i>, read
<i>continues</i>, to which the quotation clearly cannot be object; will
that affect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> our full stop?’—No; the quotation will still be part of
the sentence; not indeed a noun, as before, and object to the verb; but
an adverb, simply equivalent to <i>thus</i>, attached to the verb.</p>

<p>Satisfied on that point, the objector takes up our statement that
the quotation mark cuts communications; a similar statement was made
in the <i>Dashes</i> section about brackets and double dashes. He
submits a quotation:—Some people ‘grunt and sweat under’ very easy
burdens indeed; and a pair of brackets:—It is (not a little learning,
but) much conceit that is a dangerous thing. ‘It is surely not true
that either quotation mark or bracket cuts the communications there;
<i>under</i> in the quotation, <i>but</i> in the brackets, are in
very active communication with <i>burdens</i> and <i>conceit</i>,
outside.’ The answer is that these are merely convenient misuses of
quotation marks and brackets. A quotation and a parenthesis should be
complete in themselves, and instances that are not so may be neglected
in arguing out principles. Special rules might indeed be required in
consequence for the abnormal cases; but in practice this is not so with
quotations.—‘A last point. To adapt one of your instances, here are
two sets of sentences, stopped as I gather you would stop them:—(1) He
asked me “Can a thing both be and not be?” The question is absurd. (2)
He said “A thing cannot both be and not be”. I at once agreed. Now, if
the full stop is required after the quotation mark in the second, it
must be required after that in the first, in each case to part, not the
quotation, but the containing sentence, from the next sentence. What
right have you to omit the full stop in the first?’—None whatever; it
will not be omitted.—‘So we have an addition of some importance to the
monstrosities you said we should have to avoid.’—Well, sentences of
this type are not common except in a style of affected simplicity.—‘Or
real simplicity. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou me? And is there any particular simplicity, real or
affected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> about this:—(Richmond looked at him with an odd smile for a
moment or two before asking, as if it were the most natural question in
the world, “But is it true?”.)?’—In the Bible quotation there is, as
you say, real simplicity—or rather there was. That sort of simplicity
now would not be real, but artificial. Any one who has good reason to
imitate primitive style may imitate primitive punctuation too. But one
step forward in precision we have definitely taken from the biblical
typography: we should insist on quotation marks in such a sentence.
They do not seem pedantic or needless now; nor will a further step in
precision seem so when once it has been taken. And as to your Richmond
sentence, and ‘monstrosities’ in general, it may be confessed here,
as we are out of hearing in this discussion of all but those who are
really interested, that the word was used for the benefit only of those
who are indifferent. A sentence with two stops is not a monstrosity, if
it wants them; and that will be realized, if once sensible punctuation
gets the upper hand of neatness.</p>

<p>These are the most plausible objections on principle to a system of
using quotation marks with stops that would be in the main logical.
It may be thought, however, that it was our business to be practical
and opportunist, and suggest nothing that could not be acted on at
once. But general usage, besides being illogical, is so inconsistent,
different writers improving upon it in special details that appeal to
them, that it seemed simpler to give our idea of what would be the best
attainable, and trust to the tiro’s adopting any parts of it that may
not frighten him by their unaccustomed look.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There are single and double quotation marks, and, apart from minor
peculiarities, two ways of utilizing the variety. The prevailing one is
to use double marks for most purposes, and single ones for quotations
within quotations, as:—“Well, so he said to me ‘What do you mean by
it?’ and I said ‘I didn’t mean anything’”. Some of those who follow
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> system also use the single marks for isolated words, short
phrases, and anything that can hardly be called a formal quotation;
this avoids giving much emphasis to such expressions, which is an
advantage. The more logical method is that adopted, for instance, by
the Oxford University Press, of reserving the double marks exclusively
for quotations within quotations. Besides the loss of the useful
degrees in emphasis (sure, however, to be inconsistently utilized),
there is a certain lack of full-dress effect about important quotations
when given this way; but that is probably a mere matter of habituation.
It should be mentioned that most of the quoted quotations in this
section had originally the double marks, but have been altered to
suit the more logical method; and the unpleasantness of the needless
quotation marks with which we started has so been slightly toned down.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A common mistake, of no great importance, but resulting in more or less
discomfort or perplexity to the reader, is the placing of the first
quotation mark earlier than the place where quotation really begins.
The commonest form of it is the including of the quoter’s introductory
<i>that</i>, which it is often obvious that the original did not
contain. Generally speaking, if <i>that</i> is used the quotation
marks may be dispensed with; not, however, if the exact phraseology is
important; but at least the mark should be in the right place.</p>

<p>I remember an old scholastic aphorism, which says, ‘that the man

</div>

<p>As the aphorism descends through Latin from Aristotle (ἢ θηρίον
ἢ θεός), the precise English Words are of no importance, and the
quotation marks might as well be away; at least the first should be
after <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>The (<i>his</i>) is evidently bracketed to show that it is substituted
for the original writer’s <i>my</i>. This is very conscientious; but it
follows that either the same should have been done for <i>he</i>, or
the quotation mark should be after <i>he</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We began this section by saying that quotation marks should be used
only when necessary. A question that affects the decision to some
extent is the difference between direct, indirect, and half-and-half
quotation. We can say (1) He said ‘I will go’. (2) He said he would go.
(3) He said ‘he would go’. The first variety is often necessary for the
sake of vividness. The third is occasionally justified when, though
there is no occasion for vividness, there is some turn of phrase that
it is important for the reader to recognize as actually originating,
not with the writer, but with the person quoted; otherwise, that
variety is to be carefully avoided; how disagreeable it is will appear
in the example below. For ordinary purposes the second variety, which
involves no quotation marks, is the best.</p>

<p>Further, there may be quotation, not of other people’s words, but of
one’s own thoughts. In this case the method prevailing at present
is that exemplified in the <i>Times</i> extract below. Taken by
itself, there is no objection to it. We point out, however, that it
is irreconcilable with the principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span> explained in this section,
which demand the addition of a full stop (derived?.). That would be a
worse monstrosity than the one in the first of the three legitimate
alternatives that we add. We recommend that the <i>Times</i> method
should be abandoned, and the first or second of the others used
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>In concluding the chapter on Punctuation we may make the general remark
that the effect of our recommendations, whether advocating as in the
last section more strictness, or as in other parts more liberty, would
be, certainly, a considerable reduction in the number of diacritical
marks cutting up and disfiguring the text; and, as we think, a practice
in most respects more logical and comprehensible.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Sentence Accent</span></p>

<p>It is only necessary to read aloud any one of the sentences quoted
below, to perceive at once that there is something wrong with its
accentuation. To lay down rules on this point would be superfluous,
even if it were practicable; for in all doubtful cases the ear can
and should decide. A writer who cannot trust himself to balance his
sentences properly should read aloud all that he writes. It is useless
for him to argue that readers will not read his work aloud, and that
therefore the fault of which we are speaking will escape notice. For,
although the fault may appear to be exclusively one of sound, it
is always in fact a fault of sense: unnatural accentuation is only
the outward sign of an unnatural combination of thought. Thus, nine
readers out of ten would detect in a moment, without reading aloud,
the ill-judged structure in our first example: the writer has tried
to do two incompatible things at the same time, to describe in some
detail the appearance of his characters, and to begin a conversation;
the result is that any one reading the sentence aloud is compelled to
maintain, through several lines of new and essential information, the
tone that is appropriate only to what is treated as a matter of course.
The interrogative tone protests more loudly than any other against this
kind of mismanagement; but our examples will show that other tones are
liable to the same abuse.</p>

<p>The accentuation of each clause or principal member of a sentence
is primarily fixed by its relation to the other members: when the
internal claims of its own component parts clash with this fixed
accentuation—when, for instance, what should be read with a uniformly
declining accentuation requires for its own internal purposes a marked
rise and fall of accent—reconstruction is necessary to avoid a badly
balanced sentence. The passage from Peacock will illustrate this:
after <i>pupils</i>, and still more after <i>counterpoint</i>, the
accentuation should steadily decline to the end of the passage; but,
conflicting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> with this requirement, we have the exorbitant claims of
a complete anecdote, containing within itself an elaborately accented
speech. To represent the anecdote as an insignificant appendage to
<i>pupils</i> was a fault of sense; it is revealed to the few who would
not have perceived it by the impossibility of reading the passage
naturally.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Are Japanese Aprils always as lovely as this?’ asked the man in the
light tweed suit of two others in immaculate flannels with crimson
sashes round their waists and puggarees folded in cunning plaits round
their broad Terai hats.—<span class="smcap">D. Sladen.</span></p>

<p>‘Here we are’, he said presently, after they had turned off the main
road for a while and rattled along a lane between high banks topped
with English shrubs, and looking for all the world like an outskirt of
Tunbridge Wells.—<span class="smcap">D. Sladen.</span></p>

<p>I doubt if Haydn would have passed as a composer before a committee of
lords like one of his own pupils, who insisted on demonstrating to him
that he was continually sinning against the rules of counterpoint; on
which Haydn said to him, ‘I thought I was to teach you, but it seems
you are to teach me, and I do not want a preceptor’, and thereon he
wished his lordship a good morning.—<span class="smcap">Peacock.</span></p>

<p>She wondered at having drifted into the neighbourhood of a
person resembling in her repellent formal chill virtuousness
a windy belfry tower, down among those districts of suburban
London or appalling provincial towns passed now and then with a
shudder, where the funereal square bricks-up the church, that
Arctic hen-mother sits on the square, and the moving dead are
summoned to their round of penitential exercise by a monosyllabic
tribulation-bell.—<span class="smcap">Meredith.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The verb <i>wonder</i> presupposes the reader’s familiarity with the
circumstance wondered at; it will not do the double work of announcing
both the wonder and the thing wondered at. ‘I wondered at Smith’s being
there’ implies that my hearer knew that Smith was there; if he did
not, I should say ‘I was surprised to find...’. Accordingly, in this
very artificial sentence, the writer presupposes the inconceivable
question: ‘What were her feelings on finding that she had drifted
... tribulation-bell?’. To read a sentence of minute and striking
description with the declining accentuation that necessarily follows
the verb <i>wondered</i> is of course impossible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How doth the earth terrifie and oppress us with terrible earthquakes,
which are most frequent in China, Japan, and those eastern climes,
swallowing up sometimes six cities at once!—<span class="smcap">Burton.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Of the many possible violations of sentence accent, one—common in
inferior writers—is illustrated in the next section.</p>


<p>8. <span class="smcap">Causal ‘as’ Clauses</span></p>

<p>There are two admissible kinds of causal ‘as’ clauses—the pure and the
mixed. The pure clause assigns as a cause some fact that is already
known to the reader and is sure to occur to him in the connexion: the
mixed assigns as a cause what is not necessarily known to the reader
or present in his mind; it has the double function of conveying a new
fact, and indicating its relation to the main sentence. Context will
usually decide whether an <i>as</i> clause is pure or mixed; in the
following examples, it is clear from the nature of the two clauses that
the first is pure, the second mixed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have an edition with German notes; but that is of no use, as you do
not read German.</p>

<p>I caught the train, but afterwards wished I had not, as I presently
discovered that my luggage was left behind.</p>
</div>

<p>The second of these, it will be noticed, is unreadable, unless we slur
the <i>as</i> to such an extent as practically to acknowledge that it
ought not to be there. The reason is that, although a pure clause may
stand at any point in the sentence, a mixed one must always precede the
main statement. The pure clause, having only the subordinate function
normally indicated by <i>as</i>, is subordinate in sense as well as in
grammar; and the declining accentuation with which it is accordingly
pronounced will not be interfered with wherever we may place it. But
the mixed clause has another function, that of conveying a new fact,
for which <i>as</i> does not prepare us, and which entitles it to an
accentuation as full and as varied as that of the main statement. To
neutralize the subordinating effect of <i>as</i>, and secure the proper
accentuation, we must place the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span> clause at the beginning; where this is
not practicable, <i>as</i> should be removed, and a colon or semi-colon
used instead of a comma. Persistent usage tends of course to remove
this objection by weakening the subordinating power of conjunctions:
<i>because</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>whereas</i>, <i>since</i>, can be used
where <i>as</i> still betrays a careless or illiterate writer. There is
the same false ring in all the following sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I myself saw in the estate office of a large landed proprietor a
procession of peasant women begging for assistance, as owing to
the departure of the bread-winners the families were literally
starving.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Remove <i>as</i>, and use a heavier stop.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to read, as, by so
doing, you might learn your duty towards yourselves.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>

<p>To read; by so doing, ....</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was a barber and hairdresser, who had been at Paris, and talked
French with a cockney accent, the French sounding all the better, as
no accent is so melodious as the Cockney.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Use a semicolon and ‘for’; the assertion requires all the support that
vigorous accentuation can lend.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the very few institutions for which the Popish Church
entertains any fear, and consequently respect, as it respects nothing
which it does not fear.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>

<p><i>For</i> instead of <i>as</i> will best suit this illogical and
falsely coordinated sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everybody likes to know that his advantages cannot be attributed
to air, soil, sea, or to local wealth, as mines and quarries, ...
but to superior brain, as it makes the praise more personal to
him.—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Again the clause is a mixed one. The point of view it suggests is,
indeed, sufficiently obvious; but (unlike our typical pure clause
above—‘you do not know German’) it depends for its existence upon the
circumstances of the main sentence, which may or may not have occurred
to the reader before. The full accentuation with which the clause
must inevitably be read condemns it at once; use a colon, and remove
<i>as</i>.</p>

<p>Pure clauses, being from their nature more or less otiose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> belong
rather to the spoken than to the written language. It follows that a
good writer will seldom have a causal <i>as</i> clause of any kind at
the end of a sentence. Two further limitations remain to be noticed:</p>

<p>i. When the cause, not the effect, is obviously the whole point of the
sentence, <i>because</i>, not <i>as</i>, should be used; the following
is quite impossible English:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I make these remarks as quick shooting at short ranges has lately been
so strongly recommended.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>ii. <i>As</i> should be used only to give the cause of the thing
asserted, not the cause of the assertion, nor an illustration of its
truth, as in the following instances:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You refer me to the Encyclopaedia: you are mistaken, as I find the
Encyclopaedia exactly confirms my view.</p>

<p>The Oxford Coxswain did not steer a very good course here, as he kept
too close in to the Middlesex shore to obtain full advantage of the
tide; it made little difference, however, as his crew continued to
gain.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>My finding the Encyclopaedia’s confirmation was not the cause of
mistake, nor the keeping too close the cause of bad steering.</p>


<p>9. <span class="smcap">Wens and Hypertrophied Members</span></p>

<p>No sentence is to be condemned for mere length; a really skilful writer
can fill a page with one and not tire his reader, though a succession
of long sentences without the relief of short ones interspersed is
almost sure to be forbidding. But the tiro, and even the good writer
who is not prepared to take the trouble of reading aloud what he has
written, should confine himself to the easily manageable. The tendency
is to allow some part of a sentence to develop unnatural proportions,
or a half parenthetic insertion to separate too widely the essential
parts. The cure, indispensable for every one who aims at a passable
style, and infallible for any one who has a good ear, is reading aloud
after writing.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Careless Repetition</span></p>

<p>Conscious repetition of a word or phrase has been discussed in Part
I (Airs and Graces): in the following examples the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span> repetition is
unconscious, and proves only that the writer did not read over what he
had written.</p>

<p>These are excusable in talk, but not in print. A few pieces are given
correctly, with the usual wrong words in brackets.</p>

<p>13. Misquotation of Less Familiar Passages</p>

<p>But the greatest wrong is done to readers when a passage that may not
improbably be unknown to them is altered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was at Dublin or in his castle of Kilcolman, two miles from

<p>14. Misapplied and Misunderstood Quotations and Phrases</p>

<p>Before <i>leading question or the exception proves the rule</i> is
written, a lawyer should be consulted; before <i>cui bono</i>, Cicero;
before <i>more honoured in the breach than the observance</i>, Hamlet.
A leading question is one that unfairly helps a witness to the desired
answer; cui bono has been explained on p. 35; <i>the exception</i>,
&amp;c., is not an absurdity when understood, but it is as generally used;
<i>more honoured</i>, &amp;c., means not that the rule is generally broken,
but that it is better broken. A familiar line of Shakespeare, on the
other hand, gains by being misunderstood: ‘One touch of nature makes
the whole world kin’ merely means ‘In one respect, all men are alike’.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But <i>cui bono</i> all this detail of our debt? Has the author
given a single light towards any material reduction of it? Not a
glimmering.—<span class="smcap">Burke.</span></p>

<p>A rule dated March 3, 1801, which has never been abrogated, lays it
down that, to obtain formal leave of absence, a member must show some
sufficient cause, such as ... but this rule is more honoured in the
breach than in the observance.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Every one knows that the Governor-General in Council is invested
by statute with the supreme command of the Army and that it would
be disastrous to subvert that power. But ‘why drag in Velasquez’?
If any one wishes us to infer that Lord Kitchener has, directly or
indirectly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span> proposed to subvert this unquestioned and unquestionable
authority, they are very much mistaken.—<i>Times.</i> (Why indeed? no
worse literary treason than to spoil other people’s wit by dragging it
in where it is entirely pointless. Velasquez here outrages those who
know the story, and perplexes those who do not)</p>

<p>The Nationalist, M. Archdeacon, and M. Meslier put to the Prime
Minister several <i>leading questions</i>, such as, ‘Why were you so
willing promptly to part with M. Delcassé, and why, by going to the
conference, did you agree to revive the debate as to the unmistakable
rights...?’ To these pertinent inquiries M. Rouvier did not
reply.—<i>Times.</i> (Leading questions are necessarily not hostile,
as these clearly were)</p>

<p>The happy phrase that an Ambassador is an honest man sent abroad
to lie for his country.—<i>Westminster Gazette.</i> (Happier when
correctly quoted: sent to lie abroad for the good of)</p>
</div>


<p>15. <span class="smcap">Allusion</span></p>

<p>A writer who abounds in literary allusions necessarily appeals to a
small audience, to those acquainted with about the same set of books
as himself; they like his allusions, others dislike them. Writers
should decide whether it is not wise to make their allusions explain
themselves. In the first two instances quoted, though the reader who
knows the original context has a slight additional pleasure, any one
can see what the point is. In the last two, those who have not the
honour of the wetnurse’s and Rosamund’s acquaintance feel that the
author and the other readers with whom he is talking aside are guilty
of bad manners.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The select academy, into whose sacred precincts the audacious Becky
Sharp flung back her leaving present of the ‘Dixonary’, survives here

Partington, twirling her mop; but the tide comes on.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Sir,—Were it not for M. Kokovtsoff’s tetchiness in the matter of
metaphors, I should feel inclined to see in his protest against

Mrs. Easy’s wetnurse for the unlawfulness of her baby.—<span class="smcap">Lucien
Wolf.</span></p>

<p>Three superb glass jars—red, green, and blue—of the sort that led
Rosamund to parting with her shoes—blazed in the broad plate-glass

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>


<p>16. <span class="smcap">Incorrect Allusion</span></p>

<p>Every one who detects a writer pretending to more knowledge than he
has jumps to the conclusion that the detected must know less than the
detective, and cannot be worth his reading. Incorrect allusion of this
kind is therefore fatal.</p>

share in <i>So are they all, all honourable men.</i> Brutus, perhaps?)</p>

<p>A sturdy Benedict to propose a tax on bachelors.—<i>Westminster

the differentiation between the saint, Benedict, and the converted
bachelor, Benedick, is surely not now to be given up)</p>

<p>But impound the car for a longer or shorter period according to
the offence, and that, as the French say, ‘will give them reason

think</i>; and if they did the phrase would hardly be worth treating
as not English; they say <i>give to think</i>, which is often quoted
because it is unlike English)</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap">Dovetailed and Adapted Quotations and Phrases</span></p>

<p>The fitting into a sentence of refractory quotations, the making of
facetious additions to them, and the constructing of Latin cases with
English governing words, have often intolerably ponderous effects.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though his denial of any steps in that direction may be true in his
official capacity, <i>there is probably some smoke in the fire of

slip of the pen or a joke; but the correction of it mends matters
little)</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether ... the pied à terre which Germany
hopes she has won by her preliminary action in the Morocco question

<p>But these unsoldierlike recriminations among the Russian officers as

<p>Is there no spiritual purge to make the eye of the camel easier for a

<p>It is not in the interests of the Japanese to close the book of the
war, until they have placed themselves in the position of beati

another sentence is most awkward)</p>

<p>Resignation became a virtue of necessity for Sweden in hopes that
a better understanding might in time grow out of the new order of
things.—<i>Times.</i> (In the original phrase, <i>of necessity</i>
does not depend on <i>virtue</i>, but on <i>make</i>; and it is
intolerable without the word that gives it its meaning)</p>

<p>A special protest should be made against the practice of introducing a
quotation in two or three instalments of a word or two, each with its
separate suit of quotation marks. The only quotations that should be
cut up are those that are familiar enough to need no quotation marks,
so that the effect is not so jerky.</p>

<p>18. Trite Quotation</p>

<p>Quotation may be material or formal. With the first, the writer quotes
to support himself by the authority (or to impugn the authority) of the
person quoted; this does not concern us. With the second, he quotes
to add some charm of striking expression or of association to his own
writing. To the reader, those quotations are agreeable that neither
strike him as hackneyed, nor rebuke his ignorance by their complete
novelty, but rouse dormant memories. Quotation, then, should be adapted
to the probable reader’s cultivation. To deal in trite quotations and
phrases therefore amounts to a confession that the writer either is
uncultivated himself, or is addressing the uncultivated. All who would
not make this confession are recommended to avoid (unless in some
really new or perverted application—notum si callida verbum reddiderit
junctura novum) such things as:</p>

be wished; more in sorrow than in anger; metal more attractive; heir
of all the ages; curses not loud but deep; more sinned against than
sinning; the irony of fate; the psychological moment; the man in the
street; the sleep of the just; a work of supererogation; the pity of

mortal of—; few equals and no superior; leave severely alone; suffer

<p>No one should use these who is not sure that he will not expose his

instance, between <i>i. e.</i> and <i>e g.</i> Again, <i>sic</i> should
never be used except when a reader might really suppose that there was
a misprint or garbling; to insert it simply by way of drawing attention

<p>21. <span class="smcap">Common Parts</span></p>

<p>When two sentences coupled by a conjunction (whether coordinating or
subordinating) have one or more parts in common, there are two ways
of avoiding the full repetition of the common parts. (<i>a</i>) ‘I
see through your villany and I detest your villany’ can become ‘I see
through and detest your villany’; ‘I have at least tried to bring
about a reconciliation, though I may have failed to bring about a
reconciliation’ can become ‘I have at least tried, though I may have
failed, to bring about, &amp;c.’ (<i>b</i>) By substitution or ellipse,
the sentences become ‘I see through your villany, and detest it’ and
‘I have at least tried to bring about a reconciliation, though I may
have failed (to do so)’. Of these, the (<i>a</i>) form requires careful
handling: a word that is not common to both sentences must not be
treated as common; and one that is common, and whose position declares
that it is meant to do double duty, must not be repeated. Violations
of these rules are always more or less unsightly, and are excusable
only when the precise (<i>a</i>) form is intolerably stiff and the
(<i>b</i>) form not available. In our examples below, the words placed
in brackets are the two variants, each of which, when the other is
omitted, should, with the common or unbracketed parts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> form a complete
sentence; the conjunctions being of course ignored for this purpose.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap">Ellipse in Subordinate Clauses</span></p>

<p>The missing subject and (with one exception) the missing verb of a
subordinate clause can be supplied only from the sentence to which it
is subordinate. The exception is the verb ‘to be’. We can say ‘The
balls, when wet, do not bounce’, ‘When in doubt, play trumps’, because
the verb to be supplied is <i>are</i>, and the subject is that of
the principal sentence. Other violations of the rule occur, but are
scarcely tolerable even in the spoken language. The following are
undesirable instances:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For, though summer, I knew ... Mr. Rochester would like to see a
cheerful hearth.—<span class="smcap">C. Brontë.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We can supply <i>was</i>, but not <i>it</i>; the natural subject is

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have now seen him, and though not for long, he is a man who speaks
with Bismarckian frankness.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>‘Though I did not see him for long’, we are meant to understand. But
the <i>though</i> clause is not subordinate to the sentence containing
that subject and verb: <i>and</i> always joins coordinates and
announces the transition from one coordinate to another. Consequently,
the <i>though</i> clause must be a part (a subordinate part) of the
second coordinate, and must draw from that its subject and verb:
‘though he is not a man of Bismarckian frankness for long, ...’. Even
if we could supply <i>I saw</i> with the clause in its present place,
we should still have the absurd implication that the man’s habitual
frankness (not the writer’s perception of it) depended on the duration
of the interview. We offer three conjectural emendations: ‘I have now
seen him, though not for long; and he is a man who ...’; ‘I have now
seen him, and though I did not see him for long, I perceived that he
was a man who ...’; ‘I have now seen him, and though I did not see him
for long, I found out what he thought; for he is a man who...’.</p>


<p>24. <span class="smcap">Some Illegitimate Infinitives</span></p>

<p><i>Claim</i> is not followed by an infinitive except when the subject
of <i>claim</i> is also that of the infinitive. Thus, <i>I claim to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
be honest</i>, but not <i>I claim this to be honest</i>. The <i>Oxford
Dictionary</i> (1893) does not mention the latter use even to condemn
it, but it is now becoming very common, and calls for strong protest.
The corresponding passive use is equally wrong. The same applies to
<i>pretend</i>.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">‘Split’ Infinitives</span></p>

<p>The ‘split’ infinitive has taken such hold upon the consciences of
journalists that, instead of warning the novice against splitting his
infinitives, we must warn him against the curious superstition that the
splitting or not splitting makes the difference between a good and a
bad writer. The split infinitive is an ugly thing, as will be seen from
our examples below; but it is one among several hundred ugly things,
and the novice should not allow it to occupy his mind exclusively. Even
that mysterious quality, ‘distinction’ of style, may in modest measure
be attained by a splitter of infinitives: ‘The book is written with a
distinction (save in the matter of split infinitives) unusual in such
works.’—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Compound Passives</span></p>

<p>Corresponding to the active construction ‘... have attempted to justify
this step’, we get two passive constructions: (1) ‘This step has been
attempted to be justified’, (2) ‘It has been attempted to justify this
step’. Of these (1), although licensed by usage, is an incorrect and
slovenly makeshift:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> ‘this step’ is not the object of ‘have attempted’,
and cannot be the subject of the corresponding passive. The true object
of ‘have attempted’ is the whole phrase ‘to justify this step’, which
in (2) rightly appears as the subject, in apposition to an introductory
‘it’.—In point of clumsiness, there is perhaps not much to choose
between the two passive constructions, neither of which should be used
when it can be avoided. When the subject of the active verb ‘have
attempted’ is definite, and can conveniently be stated, the active
form should always be retained; to write ‘it had been attempted by the
founders of the study to supply’ instead of ‘the founders had attempted
to supply’ is mere perversity. When, as in some of our examples below,
the subject of the active verb ‘have attempted’ is indefinite, the
passive turn is sometimes difficult to avoid; but unless the object
of ‘justify’ is a relative, and therefore necessarily placed at the
beginning, ‘an attempt has been made’ can often be substituted for ‘it
has been attempted’, and is less stiff and ugly.</p>

<p>This is very common, but quite contrary to good modern usage, after the

the motive of the omission is obvious, but does not justify it; all

<p>We question if throughout the French Revolution there was a single

</div>

<p>The idiom <i>as who should say</i> must not be used unless the sentence
to which it is appended has for subject a person to whom the person
implied in <i>who</i> is compared. This seems reasonable, and is borne

<p>40. ‘<span class="smcap">As to whether</span>’</p>

<p>This is a form that is seldom necessary, and should be reserved for
sentences in which it is really difficult to find a substitute.
Abstract nouns that cannot be followed immediately by <i>whether</i>
should if possible be replaced by the corresponding verbs. Many writers
seem to delight in this hideous combination, and employ it not only
with abstracts that can be followed by <i>whether</i>, but even with
verbs.</p>

<p>41. <span class="smcap">Superfluous ‘but’ and ‘though’</span></p>

<p>Where there is a natural opposition between two sentences, adversative
conjunctions may yet be made impossible by something in one of
the sentences that does the work unaided. Thus if <i>in vain</i>,
<i>only</i>, and <i>reserves</i> and <i>sole</i>, had not been used in
the following sentences, <i>but</i> and <i>though</i> would have been
right; as it is, they are wrong.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(The author dreams that he is a horse being ridden) <i>In vain</i>

written.</p>

<p>42. ‘<span class="smcap">If and when</span>’</p>

<p>This formula has enjoyed more popularity than it deserves; either
‘when’ or ‘if’ by itself would almost always give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> meaning. Even
where ‘if’ seems required to qualify ‘when’ (which by itself might
be taken to exclude the possibility of the event’s never happening
at all), ‘if’ and ‘when’ are clearly not coordinate, though both are
subordinate to the main sentence: ‘if and when he comes, I will write’
means ‘if he comes, I will write when he comes’, or ‘when he comes
(if he comes at all), I will write’, and the ‘if’ clause, whether
parenthetic or not, is subordinate to the whole sentence ‘I will write
when he comes’. Our Gladstone instance below differs from the rest:
‘when’ with a past tense, unqualified by ‘if’, would make an admission
that the writer does not choose to make; on the other hand, the time
reference given by ‘when’ is essential; ‘on the occasion on which it
was done (if it really was done) it was done judicially’. The faulty
coordination may be overlooked where there is real occasion for its
use; but many writers seem to have persuaded themselves that neither
‘if’ nor ‘when’ is any longer capable of facing its responsibilities
without the other word to keep it in countenance.</p>

<p>2. Of two distinct idioms the wrong is chosen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

2,000 at the Royal Theatre the organized opposition numbered less than

upon Japan.—<i>Times.</i> (We visit upon a person his sins, or

French; it is certainly not English)</p>

there are small pitfalls in every direction.</p>

<p>44. <span class="smcap">Truisms and Contradictions in Terms</span></p>

<p>A contradiction in terms is often little more than a truism turned
inside out; we shall therefore group the two together, and with them
certain other illogical expressions, due to a similar confusion of
thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Praise which perhaps was scarcely meant to be taken <i>too</i>
literally.—<span class="smcap">Bagehot.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Where no standard of literalness is mentioned, <i>too literally</i>
is ‘more literally than was meant’. We may safely affirm, without the
cautious reservations <i>perhaps</i> and <i>scarcely</i>, that the
praise was not meant to be taken more literally than it was meant to be
taken. Omit <i>too</i>.</p>

<p>Splendid and elegant, but <i>somewhat bordering on</i> the antique
fashion.—<span class="smcap">Scott.</span></p>

like’.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Rendel, Lord ..., ..., ..., and <i>many</i> others.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Take</i> in this context means ‘consider as instances’; we cannot
consider them as instances unless we have their names; <i>take</i> must
therefore mean ‘let me name for your consideration’. Thus we get: ‘To
<i>name</i> only a <i>few</i>, let me <i>name</i> ... and <i>many</i>
others (whom I do <i>not</i> name)’.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>More <i>led away</i> by a jingling antithesis of words than <i>an
accurate perception</i> of ideas.—<span class="smcap">H. D. Macleod.</span></p>
</div>

<p>‘Guided by an accurate perception’ is what is meant. To be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span> ‘led
away by accurate perception’ is a misfortune that could happen only
in a special sense, the sense in which it has happened, possibly, to
the writer, whom sheer force of accurate perception may have hurried
into inaccurate expression; but more probably he too is the victim of
‘jingling antithesis’.</p>

<p>The necessary inference—that Mr. K., the reciter, appeared on the
platform long before the appointed hour—is probably not in accordance
with the facts.</p>

<p>He <i>forgot</i> that it was possible, that from a brief period of

</div>

<p><i>He</i> could not forget, because he could not know, anything
about the despotisms which <i>have</i> in fact followed. He might
know and forget something about all the despotisms that had preceded
or <i>should</i> follow (in direct speech, ‘that have preceded or
shall follow’): ‘this may result in the most compact despotism in all
history, past and future’. But probably Bagehot does not even mean
this: the last clause seems to contain a reflection of his own, falsely
presented as a part of what <i>he</i> ought to have reflected.</p>

<p>Some people would say that my present manner of travelling is much

<p>Only two modes of travelling are compared: <i>the most preferable</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
implies four, three of them preferable in different degrees to the
fourth. A not uncommon vulgarism.</p>


<p>45. <span class="smcap">Double Emphasis</span></p>

<p>Attempts at packing double emphasis into a single sentence are apt to
result in real weakening.</p>

any individual thumb-print; that does not make the <i>coincidence</i>
more remarkable; and it is the coincidence that we are to admire)</p>

<p>Nothing has brought out more strongly than motor-driving the
over-bearing, selfish nature of too many motor-drivers and their utter
want of consideration for their fellow men.—<span class="smcap">Lord Wemyss.</span>

very slightly wounded. For what should show up the drivers more
than the driving? and whom should the driving show up more than the

<p>The commonest form of this is due to conscientious but mistaken zeal
for correctness, which prefers, for instance, <i>without oppressing or
without plundering</i> to <i>without oppressing or plundering</i>. The
first form excludes only one of the offences, and is therefore, though
probably meant to be twice as emphatic, actually much weaker than the
second, which excludes both. With <i>and</i> instead of <i>or</i>, it
is another matter.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap">‘Split’ Auxiliaries.</span></p>

<p>Some writers, holding that there is the same objection to split
compound verbs as to split infinitives, prefer to place any adverb or
qualifying phrase not between the auxiliary and the other component,
but before both. Provided that the adverb is then separated from the
auxiliary, no harm is done: ‘Evidently he was mistaken’ is often as
good as ‘He was evidently mistaken’, and suits all requirements of
accentuation. But the placing of the adverb immediately before or
after the auxiliary depends, according to established usage, upon
the relative importance of the two components. When the main accent
is to fall upon the second component, the normal place of the adverb
is between the two; it is only when the same verb is repeated with a
change in the tense or mood of the auxiliary, that the adverb should
come first. ‘He evidently was deceived’ implies, or should imply, that
the verb <i>deceived</i> has been used before, and that the point of
the sentence depends upon the emphatic auxiliary; accordingly we should
write ‘The possibility of his being deceived had never occurred to
me; but he evidently was deceived’, but ‘I relied implicitly on his
knowledge of the facts; but he was evidently deceived’. In our first
two examples below the adverb is rightly placed first to secure the
emphasis on the auxiliary: in all the others the above principle of
accentuation is violated. The same order of words is required by the
copula with whatever kind of complement.</p>

<p>So unique a man as Sir George Lewis has, in truth, rarely been lost to

</div>

<p>The meaning is not ‘Men like Sir G. Lewis have seldom been lost’, but
‘Men like the late Sir G. Lewis have seldom been found’. But instead
of <i>the late</i> a word was required that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span> should express proper

successful in the main’; that is shown by the qualifying parenthesis,

mean ought to have been given in two sentences: ‘There are but few ...
adventure;—’s, moreover, was for the most part crowned with success’.</p>

<p>Of the forms, <i>persons interested</i>, <i>the persons interested</i>,
<i>those interested</i>, <i>those who are interested</i>, one or
another may better suit a particular phrase or context. <i>Those
interested</i> is the least to be recommended, especially with
an active participle or adjective. The form <i>those persons
interested</i> is a hybrid, and is very seldom used by any good writer;
but it is becoming so common in inferior work that it is thought
necessary to give many examples. The first two, of the form <i>those
interested</i>, will pass, though <i>those who were concerned</i>,
<i>all who drive</i>, would be better. In the others <i>that</i> and
<i>those</i> should be either replaced by <i>the</i> or (sometimes)

<p>49. <span class="smcap">False Scent</span></p>

<p>It is most annoying to a reader to be misled about the construction,
and therefore most foolish in a writer to mislead him. In the sentences
that follow, <i>facilities</i> and <i>excesses</i> are naturally taken
as in the same construction, and similarly <i>influences</i> and
<i>nature</i>, until the ends of the sentences show us that we have
gone wrong. These are very bad cases; but minor offences of the kind
are very common, and should be carefully guarded against.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He gloats over the facilities the excesses and the blunders of the
authorities have given his comrades for revolutionary action among the

<p>The influences of that age, his open, kind, susceptible nature,
to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span> nothing of his highly untoward situation, made it
more than usually difficult for him to cast aside or rightly
subordinate.—<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>That there is no comma between <i>facilities</i> and <i>the
excesses</i> is no defence, seeing how often commas go wrong; indeed
the comma after <i>age</i> in the second piece, which is strictly
wrong, is a proof how little reliance is to be placed on such signs.</p>


<p>50. <span class="smcap">Misplacement of Words</span></p>

<p>Generous interpretation will generally get at a writer’s meaning; but
for him to rely on that is to appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i>. Appended
to the sentences, when necessary, is the result of supposing them to
mean what they say.</p>

more than other people)</p>

<p>It is from this fate that the son of a commanding prime minister

<p>But in 1798 the Irish rising was crushed in a defeat of the insurgents

it saved him from)</p>
</div>


<p>51. <span class="smcap">Ambiguous Position</span></p>

<p>In this matter judgement is required. A captious critic might find
examples on almost every page of almost any writer; but most of
them, though they may strictly be called ambiguous, would be quite
justifiable. On the other hand a careless writer can nearly always
plead, even for a bad offence, that an attentive reader would take
the thing the right way. That is no defence; a rather inattentive and
sleepy reader is the true test; if the run of the sentence is such that
he at first sight refers whatever phrase is in question to the wrong
government, then the ambiguity is to be condemned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Louis XVIII, dying in 1824, was succeeded, as Charles X, by his
brother the Count d’Artois.—<span class="smcap">E. Sanderson.</span> (The sleepy
reader, assisted by memories of James the First and Sixth, concludes,
though not without surprise, which perhaps finally puts him on the
right track, that Louis XVIII of France was also Charles X of some
other country)</p>

<p>In 1830 Paris overthrew monarchy by divine right.—<span class="smcap">Morley.</span>
(<i>By divine right</i> looks so much more like an adverbial
than an adjectival phrase that the sleepy reader takes it with
<i>overthrew</i>)</p>

<p>(From review of a book on ambidexterity) Two kinds of emphatic
type are used, and both are liberally sprinkled about the pages
on some principle which is not at all obvious. The practice may
have its merits, like ambidexterity, but it is generally eschewed
by good writers who know their business, although they are not
ambidextrous.—<i>Times.</i> (The balance of the sentence is extremely
bad if the <i>although</i> clause is subordinated to <i>who</i>; and
the sleepy reader accordingly does not take it so, but with <i>is
eschewed</i>, and so makes nonsense)</p>

<p>It was a temper not only legal, but pedantic in its legality,
intolerant from its very sense of a moral order and law <i>of</i> the
lawlessness and disorder of a personal tyranny.—<span class="smcap">J. R. Green.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>Both these last are very unkind to the poor sleepy reader; it is true
that in one of them he is inexcusable if he goes wrong, but we should
for our own sakes give him as few chances of going wrong as possible.</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap">Ambiguous Enumeration</span></p>

amounts with English journalists to a disease; the intemperate orgy
of moderation is renewed every morning. As <i>somewhat</i> is rapidly
swallowing up the rest, we shall almost confine our attention to it;

mutually exclusive.</p>

emphasis with <i>somewhat</i>, when we might use the gentler word by
itself.</p>

<p>A member of the Legislative Council is allowed now to speak in

<p>Some of the instances in these two classes would be defended as
humorous under-statement. But if this hackneyed trick is an example of

<p>Sir,—I have been somewhat interested in the recent correspondence in

<p>Sir Francis Bertie, whose dislike of unnecessary publicity is somewhat
pronounced.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is not too much to say that any one who hopes to write well had
better begin by abjuring <i>somewhat</i> altogether.</p>

<p>We cannot tell whether this long list will have a dissuasive effect, or
will be referred to foolish individual prejudice against an unoffending
word. But on the first assumption we should like to add that a not
less dissuasive collection might easily be made of the intensifier
<i>distinctly</i> than of the qualifier <i>somewhat</i>. The use meant
is that seen in:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The effect as the procession careers through the streets of Berlin is
described as distinctly interesting.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Distinctly</i> gives the patronizing interest, as <i>somewhat</i>
gives the contemptuous indifference, with which a superior person is
to be conceived surveying life; and context too often reveals that the
superiority is imaginary.</p>


<p>56. <span class="smcap">Clumsy Patching</span></p>

<p>When a writer detects a fault in what he has written or thought of
writing, his best course is to recast the whole sentence. The next best
is to leave it alone. The worst is to patch it in such a way that the
reader has his attention drawn, works out the original version, and
condemns his author for carelessness aggravated by too low an estimate
of his own intelligence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Numerous allegations, too, were made of prejudiced
treatment <i>measured out against</i> motorists by rural
magistrates.—<i>Times.</i> (avoidance of the jingle in <i>meted</i>
out to <i>motor</i>ists)</p>

<p>No crew proved to be of the very highest class; but this,
perhaps, <i>led the racing to be</i> on the whole close and

<p>The Lord Mayor last night entertained the Judges <i>to</i> a banquet

<p>The occupants talked, inspected the cars <i>of one another</i>,
interchanged tales of....—<i>Times.</i> (avoidance, in grammatical
pusillanimity, of <i>one another’s cars</i>)</p>

<p>... who have only themselves in view <i>by</i> breaking through
it.—<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span> (avoidance of double <i>in</i>)</p>

<p>He nodded, <i>as one who would say</i>, ‘I have already thought of
that’.—<span class="smcap">Crockett.</span> (avoidance of the archaism, which however
is the only natural form, <i>as who should say</i>)</p>

<p>It is now practically certain that the crews of Nebogatoff’s squadron
were in a state of mutiny, and that this is the explanation <i>for</i>

<p>And <i>for</i> the first time <i>after</i> twenty years the Whigs saw
themselves again in power.—<span class="smcap">J. R. Green.</span> (Avoidance of double

<p>And oppressive laws forced even these <i>few</i> with <i>scant</i>
exceptions to profess Protestantism.—<span class="smcap">J. R. Green.</span> (To avoid

admitted)</p>

<p>Given competition, any line would vie with the others in mirrors
and gilded furniture; but if there is none, why spend a penny? Not
a passenger the less will travel because the mode of transit is
<i>bestial</i>.—<span class="smcap">E. F. Benson.</span> (To avoid the overdone word
<i>beastly</i>—which however happens to be the right one here;
<i>bestial</i> describes character or conduct)</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a kind of timorous atheism in the man who dares
not trust God to <i>render</i> all efforts to interpret his
Word—and what is criticism but interpretation?—work together for
good.—<i>Spectator.</i> (<i>Render</i> is substituted for <i>make</i>
because <i>make efforts</i> might be taken as complete without the
<i>work together</i> that is due. Unfortunately, <i>to render efforts
work together</i> is not even English at all)</p>
</div>


<p>57. <span class="smcap">Omission of the Conjunction ‘that’</span></p>

<p>This is quite legitimate, but often unpleasant. It is partly a matter
of idiom, as, <i>I presume you know</i>, but <i>I assume that you
know</i>; partly of avoiding false scent, as in the sixth example
below, where <i>scheme</i> might be object to <i>discover</i>. In
particular it is undesirable to omit <i>that</i> when a long clause or
phrase intervenes between it and the subject and verb it introduces, as
in the first four examples.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And it is to be hoped, <i>as the tree-planting season has arrived</i>,
Stepney will now put its scheme in hand.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>Sir,—We notice <i>in a leading article in your issue to-day on
the subject of the carriage of Australian mails</i> you imply that
the increased price demanded by the Orient Pacific Line was due
to....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Lord Balfour ... moved that it is necessary, <i>before the
constituencies are asked to determine upon the desirability of such
conference</i>, they should be informed first....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Lord Spencer held that it was impossible <i>with regard to a question
which had broken up the Government and disturbed the country</i> they
could go into a conference which....—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>If the Australian is to be convinced that is an unreasonable wish, it
will not be by arguments about taxation.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>I think he would discover the scheme unfolded and explained in them is
a perfectly intelligible and comprehensive one.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>It is not till He cometh the ideal will be seen.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>And it is only by faith the evils you mention as productive of war can
be cast out of our hearts.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>I do not wish it to be understood that I consider all those who

employment are impostors.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>I assume Turkey would require such a cash payment of at least
£500,000.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>Tawno leaped into the saddle, where he really looked like Gunnar of
Hlitharend, save and except the complexion of Gunnar was florid,
whereas that of Tawno was of nearly Mulatto darkness.—<span class="smcap">Borrow.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In some of these the motive is obvious, to avoid one <i>that</i>-clause
depending on another; the end was good, but the means bad; a more
thorough recasting was called for.</p>


<p>58. <span class="smcap">Meaningless ‘while’</span></p>

<p><i>While</i>, originally temporal, has a legitimate use also in
contrasts. The further colourless use of it, whether with verb or
with participle, as a mere elegant variation for <i>and</i> is very
characteristic of journalese, and much to be deprecated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of its value there can be no question. The editor’s article on
‘Constitutions’, for example, and that of Mr. W. Wyse on ‘Law’ both
well repay most careful study; <i>while</i> when Sir R. Jebb writes
on ‘Literature’, Dr. Henry Jackson on ‘Philosophy’, or Professor
Waldstein on ‘Sculpture’, their contributions must be regarded as
authoritative.—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>The fireman was killed on the spot, and the driver as well as the
guard of the passenger train was slightly injured; <i>while</i> the
up-line was blocked for some time with débris from broken trucks of
the goods train.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>The deer on the island took some interest in the proceeding, while the
peacocks on the lawn screamed at the right time.—<i>Birmingham Daily
Post.</i></p>

<p>It cannot be contended that it is more profitable to convey a
passenger the twenty-four miles to Yarmouth for payment than to accept
the same payment without performing the service; <i>while</i>, if the
company wish to discourage the use of cheap week-end tickets, why
issue them at all?—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>


<p>59. <span class="smcap">Commercialisms</span></p>

<p>Certain uses of <i>such</i>, <i>the same</i>, and other words, redolent
of commerce and the law, should be reserved for commercial and legal
contexts. <i>Anent</i>, which has been noticed in Part I, is a legalism
of this kind. In the Brontë instances quoted, a twang of flippancy will
be observed; the other writers are probably unconscious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This gentleman’s state of mind was very harrowing, and I was glad when
he wound up his exposition of the same.—<span class="smcap">C. Brontë.</span></p>

<p>The present was no occasion for showy array; my dun mist crape would
suffice, and I sought the same in the great oak wardrobe in the

<p>There are certain books that almost defy classification, and this

my head I cannot engage in the outward and visible commemoration of
the Lord’s Supper as not being fit to receive the same?—<i>Daily

<p>But do the great majority of people let their belief in the hereafter
affect their conduct with regard to the same. I think not.—<i>Daily
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>Let us hope, Sir, that it may be possible in your own interests to
continue the same till the subject has had a good innings.—<i>Daily

<p>I believe, and have believed since, a tiny child, made miserable by
the loss of a shilling, I prayed my Heavenly Father to help me to
recover the same.—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>It is of course possible, in this connexion, that the Prayer Book is
responsible for ‘the same’.</p>

<p>If I am refused the Sacrament I do not believe that I shall have

Dublin.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>60. <span class="smcap">Pet Phrases</span></p>

<p>Vivid writers must be careful not to repeat any conspicuous phrase so
soon that a reader of ordinary memory has not had time to forget it
before it invites his attention again. Whatever its merits, to use it
twice (unless deliberately and with point) is much worse than never
to have thought of it. The pages below are those of Green’s <i>Short
History</i> (1875).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The temper of the first [King George] was that of a gentleman usher.
p. 704.</p>

<p>Bute was a mere court favourite, with the abilities of a gentleman
usher. p. 742.</p>

<p>‘For weeks’, laughs Horace Walpole, ‘it rained gold boxes’. p. 729.</p>

<p>‘We are forced to ask every morning what victory there is’, laughed
Horace Walpole. p. 737.</p>
</div>

<p>The two following passages occur on pp. 6 and 81 of <i>The Bride of
Lammermoor</i> (Standard Edition).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In short, Dick Tinto’s friends feared that he had acted like the
animal called the sloth, which, having eaten up the last green leaf
upon the tree where it has established itself, ends by tumbling down
from the top, and dying of inanition.</p>

<p>‘... but as for us, Caleb’s excuses become longer as his diet turns
more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span> spare, and I fear we shall realise the stories they tell of
the sloth: we have almost eaten up the last green leaf on the plant,
and have nothing left for it but to drop from the tree and break our
necks.’</p>
</div>


<p>61. <span class="smcap">‘Also’ as Conjunction; and</span> ‘&amp;c.’</p>

<p><i>Also</i> is an adverb; the use of it as a conjunction is slovenly,
if not illiterate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are giving these explanations gently as friends, also patiently as
becomes neighbours.—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>‘Special’ is a much overworked word, it being used to mean great in
degree, also peculiar in kind.—<span class="smcap">R. G. White.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Sonnenschein’s volume will show by parallel passages Shakespeare’s
obligations to the ancients, also the obligations of modern writers to
Shakespeare.—<i>Times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The use of <i>&amp;c.</i>, except in business communications and such
contexts, has often the same sort of illiterate effect. This is very
common, but one example must suffice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are others with faults of temper, &amp;c., evident enough, beside
whom we live content, as if the air about them did us good.—<span class="smcap">C.
